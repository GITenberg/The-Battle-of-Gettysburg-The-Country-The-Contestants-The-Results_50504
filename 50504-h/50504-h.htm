<h2 id="c1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>No one is better fitted to describe the Battle
of Gettysburg and the National Park established
on its site than Mr. William C. Storrick.
Born a short distance from the field, he was seven
years old at the time of the battle. He remembers the
flight from home as the army drew near; he remembers
also the return to a house which had been occupied
by troops. Still more distinctly he recalls going
to Gettysburg on November 19, standing with his
hand clasped in his father&rsquo;s, watching a doorway from
which the President of the United States was shortly
to appear. He shook hands with Lincoln, was awed
by his great height, and listened eagerly to his plain
and simple address.</p>
<p>For more than twenty years Mr. Storrick was
connected with the Battlefield Commission, first in
charge of the farms, then of the guide service as well.
The history of the campaign which forms a part of
this volume was prepared at the request of the War
Department.</p>
<p>There is no corner of the field which Mr. Storrick
does not know; there is no detail of its history which
he has not studied; there is no disputed question of
which he cannot give both sides. His clear and uncontroversial
account of the battle is but an outline of
his store of information upon which he plans to draw
more largely in a volume of greater scope.</p>

<p>It is difficult to present a great battle with sufficient
detail to please both the student of tactics and the
average reader. If the visitor is not satisfied with
the brief outline here presented, he is recommended
to read further in the books listed, and especially to
employ a guide, without whose trained and supervised
services the best manual is inadequate. The reader in search
of romance is recommended to the successive Incidents of the
Battle as herein presented.</p>
<p>According to official records, the Gettysburg campaign of 1863
began on June 3rd and ended on August 1st. No effort will be
made to describe the movements, counter-movements, and fifty
minor engagements that occurred before the armies crossed the
Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s line and finally concentrated at Gettysburg,
where they engaged in battle on July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. It is
necessary, however, that the visitor should understand the approach
to the field.</p>
<h3>Location of the Armies.</h3>
<p>On June 3rd the Union Army, called the Army of the Potomac,
lay at Falmouth, Va., on the north side of the Rappahannock
River, Major-General Joseph Hooker in command.</p>
<p>The Confederate Army, called the Army of Northern Virginia,
occupied the south bank, with headquarters at Fredericksburg,
General Robert E. Lee in command.</p>
<p>Both armies were resting after the major engagement at
Chancellorsville, in which the Confederates were victorious.</p>
<p>The Army of the Potomac was made up of seven infantry and
one cavalry corps. It numbered at the time of the battle approximately
84,000.</p>
<p>The Army of Northern Virginia was made up of three infantry
corps and one division of cavalry. It numbered at the time of the
battle about 75,000.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Following the text is a roster of officers, which should be consulted,
both for an understanding of the battle and because of the
obligation to honor brave men.</p>
<h3>General Lee&rsquo;s Plan.</h3>
<p>During the month of May, General Lee visited Richmond to
discuss with the Confederate government various plans involving
political and military considerations. Up to this time, the South
had won the major victories, but her resources, both in men and
sinews of war, were diminishing, and a prolonged conflict would be
disastrous. It was decided that the army should invade the
North via the Shenandoah and Cumberland valleys, with Harrisburg
as an objective. This route not only afforded a continuous
highway but put the army in a position to threaten Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and Washington from the north. The Blue Ridge
Mountains to the east would screen the advance, and the rich
agricultural section would furnish supplies of food and forage.</p>
<p>The time was propitious. General Lee&rsquo;s army was in the prime
of condition. The North was discouraged by losses, distrustful
of Lincoln, weary of war. The South believed that one great
victory would assure her the friendliness of the leading powers of
Europe. Her independence once acknowledged, she could import
the materials of war and the necessities of life which she lacked.
It was thought certain that at the prospect of invasion the North
would withdraw troops from the siege of Vicksburg then being
conducted by General Grant. With high hopes the march was
begun.</p>
<h3>Lee&rsquo;s First Movement.</h3>
<p>On June 3rd Lee put his army in motion northward, with Ewell&rsquo;s
Corps, preceded by Jenkins&rsquo; and Imboden&rsquo;s Cavalry, in the advance,
followed by Longstreet and lastly by Hill. Longstreet
moved on the east side of the Blue Ridge in order to lead Hooker
to believe that Washington would be threatened. On reaching
Snicker&rsquo;s Gap, he crossed the Ridge into the Shenandoah Valley
and followed Hill, who was now in advance. The great army was
strung out from Fredericksburg, Va., on the south to Martinsburg,
W. Va., on the north, with the cavalry division under Stuart
guarding the gaps along the Blue Ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="pcap">Since 1863 the population of Gettysburg has increased from 2,000 to 5,500</p>
</div>
<p>After driving out Union forces stationed at Winchester under
Milroy, Lee&rsquo;s Army crossed the Potomac at Williamsport and
Shepherdstown on June 23rd, 24th, and 25th, and advanced northward,
unopposed, through the Cumberland Valley, toward
Harrisburg.</p>
<h3>Hooker&rsquo;s Plan.</h3>
<p>On June 10th, Hooker proposed to President Lincoln that he
cross the Rappahannock and attack Hill, who still remained, and
then move south, threatening Richmond. He thought this might
divert Lee from his invasion of the North. In reply Lincoln said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I think Lee&rsquo;s Army and not Richmond is your sure objective point.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Appointment of Meade.</h3>
<p>Thereupon Hooker started in pursuit of Lee on June 13th,
moving east of the Blue Ridge on a line parallel with Lee on the
west, with the cavalry guarding his left. He thus protected
Baltimore and Washington. He crossed the Potomac at Edward&rsquo;s
Ferry on the 25th and 26th and reached Frederick on the 27th,
where he halted. Believing himself handicapped by orders from
General Halleck, Chief in Command at Washington, who refused
the use of the Union forces at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, he asked to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
relieved of the command of the Army of the Potomac. The request
was granted, and, on June 28th, Major-General George G. Meade,
in command of the 5th Corps, was appointed his successor, Sykes
taking command of General Meade&rsquo;s Corps.</p>
<h3>Advance of Lee.</h3>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s Army had been steadily moving northward in the Cumberland
Valley. Ewell, in the advance, detached Early&rsquo;s Division on
reaching Chambersburg, directing him to move through Gettysburg
on June 26th and thence to York and Wrightsville, there to
cross the Susquehanna to Columbia and move up to Harrisburg
to meet the divisions of Rodes and Johnson. Rodes reached
Carlisle on June 28th, accompanied by Ewell; Johnson was at
Greenvillage, between Chambersburg and Carlisle. Hill moved
from Chambersburg to Cashtown, and Longstreet was in the rear
at Chambersburg. Lee&rsquo;s headquarters were in Messersmith&rsquo;s
Woods near Chambersburg.</p>

statue, pointing toward the spectator, is the first gun fired by the Union forces</p>
</div>
<p>In his advance into Gettysburg, Early was opposed by the
26th Emergency Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers, Company
A, consisting of students of Pennsylvania (now Gettysburg)
College, citizens of the town, and some volunteers from Harrisburg.
After skirmishing on the Chambersburg Pike about 3 miles from
the town, this regiment was obliged to retreat, finally reaching
Harrisburg. About 175 were captured, but were afterward paroled.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
On the same day, George Sandoe, a Union scout, was shot by one
of Early&rsquo;s pickets on the Baltimore Pike. He was the first Union
soldier killed in the vicinity of Gettysburg prior to the battle.</p>
<p>On account of the absence of his cavalry under Stuart, who had
been left with five brigades to guard the rear and hold the gaps of
the Blue Ridge, Lee did not know until June 28th that the Union
Army had crossed the Potomac and was threatening his line of
communication with the South. Learning this, he ordered a concentration
of his forces at Cashtown.</p>
<h3>Meade&rsquo;s Movement.</h3>
<p>On assuming command, General Meade moved his army northward
from the vicinity of Frederick and established a tentative
line along Pipe Creek, between Manchester on his right and Emmitsburg
on his left, with headquarters near Taneytown.</p>
<h3>Stuart&rsquo;s Movement.</h3>
<p>After the Union Army crossed the Potomac, Stuart left the line
of the Blue Ridge with three brigades of cavalry and made a
raid around the Union Army, crossing the Potomac at Seneca
Creek and moving thence to Hanover, where he engaged Kilpatrick&rsquo;s
Division of Union cavalry on June 30th. Passing through
Jefferson, Dover, and Dillsburg to Carlisle, he reached Carlisle
on the afternoon of July 1st, getting into communication with Lee,
after an interval of a week.</p>
<h3>Situation of Confederate Forces on June 30th.</h3>
<p>On June 30th, Pender&rsquo;s Division, Hill&rsquo;s Corps, moved from
Fayetteville to Cashtown; Anderson&rsquo;s Division to Fayetteville;
Rodes&rsquo; Division, Ewell&rsquo;s Corps, from Carlisle via Petersburg to
Heidlersburg. Early&rsquo;s Division advanced from York through
Weiglestown and East Berlin, and encamped 3 miles from Heidlersburg.
Johnson&rsquo;s Division marched from Greenvillage to
Scotland. Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps,
moved from Chambersburg to Fayetteville; Pickett&rsquo;s Division remained
at Chambersburg. Lee&rsquo;s headquarters were at Greenwood.</p>
<h3>Situation of Union Forces on June 30th.</h3>
<p>On June 30th the 11th Corps was at Emmitsburg, the 1st at
Marsh Creek, the 3rd at Bridgeport, the 5th at Union Mills, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
6th at Manchester, the 12th at Littlestown, the 2nd at Taneytown.
Two brigades of Buford&rsquo;s Cavalry Division were at Gettysburg;
Gregg&rsquo;s Cavalry Division was at Manchester; Kilpatrick&rsquo;s at
Hanover. Meade&rsquo;s headquarters were at Taneytown.</p>
<h3>The Approach.</h3>
<p>Neither commander yet
foresaw Gettysburg as a field
of battle. Each had expected
to take a strong position and
force his adversary to attack.
But in the hot summer weather
fate was moving the mighty
hosts closer and closer. The
sky was cloudless, and the summer
moon was at its brightest.
The wheat was ripe, and the
armies marched between partly
reaped fields.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">The Pennsylvania Monument</span>, with

</div>
<p>On the 30th, Hill, in the
front at Cashtown, sent Pettigrew&rsquo;s
Brigade to Gettysburg
for supplies, shoes especially being badly needed. In the meantime,
Meade ordered Buford, with two brigades of cavalry at
Emmitsburg, to make a reconnaissance to Gettysburg. Buford
reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I entered this place today at 11</i> <span class="small">A.M.</span> <i>Found everybody in a terrible state
of excitement on account of the enemy&rsquo;s advance.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On reaching Seminary Ridge, Pettigrew saw the approach of
Buford. Not wishing to bring on an engagement, he withdrew to
the vicinity of Cashtown.</p>
<p>Buford moved through the town and bivouacked for the night
west of the Seminary, along McPherson Ridge. He assigned to
Gamble&rsquo;s Brigade the task of watching the Fairfield and Cashtown
roads and to Devin the Mummasburg, Middletown (now Biglerville),
and Harrisburg roads. Early on the morning of the 1st, he
picketed all the roads leading north and northeast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c4">THE FIRST DAY</h2>
<p>Informed by Pettigrew that Union forces had reached
Gettysburg, and anxious to know their strength, Hill sent
Heth&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s Divisions with Pegram&rsquo;s battalion of
artillery forward on a reconnaissance in force. This movement,
made at 5.30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on July 1, precipitated the battle.</p>
<p>The advance was soon interrupted by Buford&rsquo;s skirmishers.
On reaching Herr Ridge, which crosses the Cashtown Road at right
angles, Hill deployed his line of battle&mdash;Heth on both sides of the
road with Pender in reserve. Pegram posted his artillery on Herr
Ridge, and at 8 o&rsquo;clock fired his first shot. Buford&rsquo;s artillery,
under Calef, posted on the opposite ridge, fired in reply. The
battle was on, and the gravity of the situation was clear to Buford,
who at 10.10 <span class="small">A.M.</span> sent this message to Meade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The enemy&rsquo;s force are advancing on me at this point and driving my
pickets and skirmishers very rapidly. There is a large force at Heidlersburg
that is driving my pickets at that point from that direction. I am sure that
the whole of A. P. Hill&rsquo;s force is advancing.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Arrival of Reynolds.</h3>
<p>Union reinforcements were at hand. General Reynolds, in
advance of the 1st Corps, arrived from Marsh Creek, via the
Emmitsburg Road. After a short conference with Buford at the
Seminary buildings, he sent an orderly urging Wadsworth, whose
division was advancing across the fields, to hasten. On its arrival,
Reynolds posted Cutler to the right, across the railroad cut which
lies parallel to the Chambersburg Pike, and Meredith on the left.
(Reynolds Avenue now marks this line.)</p>
<h3>Death of Reynolds.</h3>
<p>After posting Hall&rsquo;s battery in place of Calef&rsquo;s, Reynolds rode
to the McPherson Woods, and while directing the advance of
Meredith at 10.15 <span class="small">A.M.</span> was instantly killed by a Confederate
sharpshooter. Doubleday consequently assumed command of the
1st Corps, and Rowley succeeded Doubleday in command of the
Division. Compelled to fall back into the grove, Buford moved
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
his cavalry to the left near the Fairfield Road, and Meredith advanced
into the woods, drove Hill&rsquo;s right across Willoughby Run,
and captured General Archer and part of his men.</p>
<p>On the Union right, Cutler was attacked in flank by Davis&rsquo;s Brigade,
of the left of Hill&rsquo;s line,
and was compelled to withdraw.
Davis advanced into the railroad
cut where part of his force
was captured. He then withdrew
to his original line.</p>
<h3>A Morning Lull.</h3>
<p>At 11 <span class="small">A.M.</span> there was a lull.
Doubleday withdrew his forces
from across Willoughby Run
and established a new line
through the McPherson Woods
from north to south. Robinson&rsquo;s
Division reached the field and
was held in reserve at the Seminary
buildings. Rowley&rsquo;s Division
(formerly Doubleday&rsquo;s)
arrived a little later; Stone&rsquo;s
Brigade of this Division was
deployed in the front line on
what is now Stone Avenue, and Biddle&rsquo;s Brigade was placed on the
left of Meredith, along what is now South Reynolds Avenue. In
the afternoon, Robinson&rsquo;s Division was moved to the right, prolonging
the Union line to the Mummasburg Road in order to meet
the advance of Rodes&rsquo; Division, coming forward via the Carlisle
Road. Devin&rsquo;s cavalry was moved from Buford&rsquo;s right to the vicinity
of the York Pike and the Hanover Road.</p>

portico was erected in 1913 to commemorate
the fiftieth anniversary of the battle.</p>
</div>
<p>In this preliminary action of the forenoon the advantage was in
favor of the Union forces. The Confederate General Heth reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The enemy had now been felt, and found in heavy force in and around
Gettysburg. The division was now formed in line of battle on the right of the
road; Archer&rsquo;s brigade on the right, Pettigrew&rsquo;s in the center, and Brockenbrough&rsquo;s
on the left. Davis&rsquo;s brigade was kept on the left of the road that it
might collect its stragglers, and from its shattered condition it was not deemed
advisable to bring it again into action that day.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The Union General Buford reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On July 1, between 8 and 9</i> <span class="small">A.M.</span> <i>reports came in from the 1st Brigade
(Colonel Gamble&rsquo;s) that the enemy was coming down from toward Cashtown
in force. Colonel Gamble made an admirable line of battle, and moved off
proudly to meet him. The two lines soon became hotly engaged, we having the
advantage of position, he of numbers. The 1st Brigade held its own for more
than two hours, and had to be literally dragged back a few hundred yards to
a more secure and sheltered position.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Arrival of Rodes and Early.</h3>
<p>On learning at Middletown (now Biglerville) that Hill was
engaged with the Union forces at Gettysburg, Rodes marched
thither directly via the Carlisle Road. Early approached via the
Harrisburg or Heidlersburg Road. The advance of both was
quickened by the sound of cannonading. Arriving a little past
noon, Rodes deployed his Division of five brigades on both sides
of Oak Ridge, his right on the left of Heth&rsquo;s Division and his left
with Early&rsquo;s right, extending across the plain north of the town.
Carter&rsquo;s artillery was posted on Oak Hill.</p>
<h3>The Opposing Lines.</h3>
<p>Robinson&rsquo;s Division of the 1st Union Corps was moved from its
position in reserve at the Seminary buildings to the right of
Cutler, to oppose Rodes&rsquo;s Confederate line.</p>
<p>Hill prolonged his right by bringing up Pender&rsquo;s Division that
had been held in reserve. The artillery of McIntosh&rsquo;s battalion
was brought into action in support. These guns, with Carter&rsquo;s
and Pegram&rsquo;s, together numbering 60, and 11 brigades of infantry
now opposed the 1st Union Corps of 36 guns and 6 brigades.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Howard.</h3>
<p>General Howard, in command of the 11th Union Corps, reached
Gettysburg from Emmitsburg between 10 and 11 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, in advance
of his Corps, and took command of the Union forces. Schurz
succeeded Howard in command of the Corps, and Doubleday
resumed command of his Division.</p>
<p>On reaching Gettysburg, Howard went to the top of the
Fahnestock building at the corner of Baltimore and Middle streets
to observe the lines of battle. He reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I had studied the position a few moments, when a report reached me that
General Reynolds was wounded. At first I hoped his wound might be slight
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
and that he would continue to command, but in a short time I was undeceived.
His aid-de-camp, Major William Riddle, brought the sad tidings of his death.
This was about 11.30</i> <span class="small">A.M.</span> <i>Prior to this the General had sent me orders to
move up at a double quick, for he was severely engaged. On hearing of the death
of Reynolds, I assumed command of the left wing, instructing General Schurz
to take command of the 11th Corps. After an examination of the general
features of the country, I came to the conclusion that the only tenable position
for my limited force was the ridge to the southeast of Gettysburg (now well
known as Cemetery Ridge). I at once established my headquarters near the
cemetery, and on the highest point north of the Baltimore Pike.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Howard&rsquo;s Position.</h3>
<p>On the arrival of the 11th Corps, Howard ordered Schurz to
move the 3rd and 1st Divisions to positions north of the town,
while the 2nd Division was held on Cemetery Hill in reserve. On
account of the prior arrival of the Confederates under Rodes,
who covered the plain north of the town, Schurz was unable to
connect with the right of the Union line on Oak Hill, and a gap
remained between the two lines. The position of the 11th Corps
coincides with what is now Howard Avenue.</p>
<h3>The Confederate General Early&rsquo;s Position.</h3>
<p>Shortly after the 11th Corps moved to the front, Early&rsquo;s
Division of Ewell&rsquo;s Corps arrived from Heidlersburg and went into
line to the right of Howard, connecting with Rodes&rsquo;s left across
the plain. Early posted his artillery, Jones&rsquo;s battalion, in position
to enfilade the right of Howard, while Carter&rsquo;s batteries on Oak
Hill enfiladed the left. The Confederate forces largely exceeded
the Union forces, the former being about 28,000 and the latter
about 18,000. The whole Confederate line advanced and attacked
the Union forces in front and on both flanks. On Oak Hill part of
Rodes&rsquo; forces, O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s and Iverson&rsquo;s brigades, were repulsed, a
large part of the latter being captured.</p>
<h3>The Union Retreat.</h3>
<p>After a strenuous resistance the whole Union line was compelled
to withdraw to Cemetery Hill. The 11th Corps retreated
through the center of town where many were captured. The 1st
Corps fell back through the western part of the town. By 4.30
<span class="small">P.M.</span> all the territory held by the Union forces was occupied by the
Confederates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3>Arrival of Lee.</h3>
<p>General Lee reached the field from Cashtown about 3 <span class="small">P.M.</span>,
witnessed the retreat of the Union forces, and established his headquarters
in tents in an apple orchard back of the Seminary. He
ordered Ewell to follow up the
repulse if he thought it practicable.
In this connection Ewell
reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The enemy had fallen back to a
commanding position known as
Cemetery Hill, south of Gettysburg,
and quickly showed a formidable
front there. On entering the town,
I received a message from the Commanding
General to attack this hill,
if I could do so to advantage. I could
not bring artillery to bear on it, and
all the troops with me were jaded by
twelve hours&rsquo; marching and fighting,
and I was notified that General
Johnson&rsquo;s division (the only one of
my corps that had not been engaged)
was close to town. Cemetery Hill was
not assailable from the town.... Before
Johnson could be placed in
position the night was far advanced.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">John Burns</span>, Gettysburg constable and
Mexican War veteran, shouldered his musket
and went out to meet the Confederates.</p>
</div>
<p>General Hill reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Under the impression that the
enemy was entirely routed, my own
two divisions exhausted by some six hours&rsquo; hard fighting, prudence led me
to be content with what had been gained.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The failure of Ewell to follow up the repulse and capture
Cemetery Hill and Culp&rsquo;s Hill, defended by a weak line of the
Union forces, enabled the Union commanders to establish during
the night a line of defence that was secure against attack. By
many military critics, this is generally considered Lee&rsquo;s lost
opportunity.</p>
<h3>Formation of Union Line.</h3>
<p>The retreating Union soldiers were met at East Cemetery Hill
by Generals Hancock and Howard, who directed them to positions,
the 1st Corps on Cemetery Ridge and Culp&rsquo;s Hill, and the 11th
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
on East Cemetery Hill. The 12th Corps arrived on the Baltimore
Pike, and soon after Sickles&rsquo; 3rd Corps came up from Emmitsburg.</p>
<p>Hancock had been instructed by Meade to take command and
report if he thought the ground a suitable place to continue the
battle. A battle-line was at once established on Cemetery Ridge.
Geary&rsquo;s Division of the 12th Corps was ordered to the extreme
left to occupy Little Round Top. Hancock sent word to General
Meade that the position was strong, but that it might be easily
turned. He then turned over the command to Slocum, his senior,
and returned to Taneytown to report in person. Meade had already
ordered a rapid concentration of all his forces at Gettysburg.</p>

<h3>General Lee&rsquo;s Report.</h3>
<p>For the day, the Confederate commander reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The leading division of Hill met the enemy in advance of Gettysburg on
the morning of July 1. Driving back these troops to within a short distance of
the town, he there encountered a larger force, with which two of his divisions
became engaged. Ewell coming up with two of his divisions by the Heidlersburg
road, joined in the engagement. The enemy was driven through Gettysburg
with heavy loss, including about 5,000 prisoners and several pieces of artillery.
He retired to a high range of hills south and east of the town. The attack was
not pressed that afternoon, the enemy&rsquo;s force being unknown, and it being
considered advisable to await the arrival of the rest of our troops. Orders were
sent back to hasten their march, and, in the meantime, every effort was made
to ascertain the numbers and position of the enemy, and find the most favorable
point of attack. It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
from our base, unless attacked by the enemy, but, finding ourselves
unexpectedly confronted by the Federal Army, it became a matter of difficulty
to withdraw through the mountains with our large trains.... Encouraged by
the successful issue of the engagement of the first day, and in view of the valuable
results that would ensue from the defeat of the army of General Meade, it
was thought advisable to renew the attack.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Death of Major-General Reynolds</h4>
<p>Major-General John Fulton Reynolds, killed at Gettysburg while commanding
the 1st Corps, was born in Lancaster, Pa., on the 21st day of September, 1820.
His father, John Reynolds, also a native of Lancaster County, was the son of
William Reynolds, who came to America in 1760 from Ireland. His mother&rsquo;s
maiden name was Lydia Moore, daughter of Samuel Moore, who held a commission
in the Revolutionary Army. He had an elder brother, William, who served as
Admiral in our Navy with great distinction, and also two other brothers who
served in the war, one as paymaster, and the other, the youngest of the four, as
Quartermaster-General of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>William and John went first to an excellent school at Lititz, in Lancaster
County, going thence to Long Green, Md., and from there they returned to the
Lancaster Academy. Through the influence of James Buchanan, they received
appointments, one as midshipman in the Navy, and the other as cadet at West
Point. John was graduated from West Point on June 22nd, 1841, at the age of
twenty-one. He served with distinction during the Mexican War, and at the outbreak
of the Civil War entered the Union Army. At the battle of Gaines&rsquo; Mill, on
June 28th, 1862, he was captured, and after a confinement of six weeks in Libby
Prison, he was exchanged for General Barksdale.</p>
<p>General Reynolds was six feet tall, with dark hair and eyes. He was erect in
carriage and a superb horseman, so much at ease in the saddle as to be able to
pick a dime from the ground while riding at full speed. He was killed in the grove
now known as Reynolds&rsquo; Grove on the morning of July 1st, between 10 and 11
o&rsquo;clock, while directing the attack of Meredith&rsquo;s brigade against Archer&rsquo;s Confederate
brigade. His body was first taken to the Seminary, and later to Lancaster,
where it was interred in the family graveyard.</p>
<h4>The 26th Emergency Regiment</h4>
<p>The 26th Emergency Regiment met the advance of Gordon&rsquo;s brigade of Early&rsquo;s
Division of Ewell&rsquo;s Corps in their advance into Gettysburg. Company A consisted
of students of the Lutheran Theological Seminary, Pennsylvania (now Gettysburg)
College, and citizens of the town. H. M. M. Richards, of Company A gives the
following sketch of the services of the regiment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the first indication of an invasion of Pennsylvania, the 26th Regiment,
P. V. M., was organized and mustered into the United States service at Harrisburg,
under the command of Colonel W. W. Jennings of that city. Company A of this
regiment, to which I belonged, was composed of students from the Lutheran
Theological Seminary and the Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg, and of citizens
of the town; one other company came from Hanover, but a few miles distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On June 23rd we left Harrisburg for Gettysburg, to be used, I believe, as
riflemen among the hills at or near Cashtown. A railroad accident prevented this
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
plan from being carried out, and kept us from reaching Gettysburg until the 26th,
by which time General Early had reached Cashtown. In accordance with orders
received from Major Granville O. Haller, acting aide-de-camp to General Couch,
commanding the Department of the Susquehanna, we were marched out on the
Chambersburg Pike at 10 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, June 26th, for a distance of about three and a half
miles, accompanied by Major Robert Bell, who commanded a troop of horse, also
raised, I understand, in Gettysburg. Having halted, our colonel, accompanied by
Major Bell, rode to the brow of an elevation and there saw General Early&rsquo;s troops
a few miles distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, a few hundred men at most, were in the toils; what should be done? We
would gladly have marched to join the Army of the Potomac, under Meade, but
where was it? Our colonel, left to his own resources, wisely decided to make an
effort to return to Harrisburg, and immediately struck off from the pike, the Confederates
capturing many of our rear-guard after a sharp skirmish, and sending
their cavalry in pursuit of us. These later overtook us in the afternoon at Witmer&rsquo;s
house, about four and a half miles from Gettysburg on the Carlisle Road, where,
after an engagement, they were repulsed with some loss. After many vicissitudes,
we finally reached Harrisburg, having marched 54 out of 60 consecutive hours,
with a loss of some 200 men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be added that Gettysburg, small town as it was, had already furnished
its quota to the army. Moreover, on the first day of the battle, hundreds of the
unfortunate men of Reynolds&rsquo;s gallant corps were secreted, sheltered, fed, and
aided in every way by the men and women of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The First Soldier Killed at Gettysburg</h4>
<p>George W. Sandoe, the first Union soldier killed at Gettysburg, was a member
of Company B Independent 21st Pennsylvania Cavalry. Upon arriving at Gettysburg,
June 26th, 1863, General Gordon sent out a picket line on the Baltimore Pike.
As these pickets reached the Nathaniel Lightner property, George W. Sandoe and
William Lightner, also a member of Company B, approached the pike, coming
across the McAllister field from the direction of Rock Creek. Owing to a growth
of bushes and trees along the fence, they did not discover the Confederate pickets
until they were ordered to halt. Lightner at once jumped his horse across the fence
and escaped by riding rapidly down the pike. Sandoe&rsquo;s horse fell in making the
leap, and in attempting to escape by riding back in the direction from which he
came, Sandoe was shot. He lies buried at Mount Joy Church, in Mount Joy,
Adams County.</p>
<h4>A Mysterious Letter</h4>
<p>Having passed through Gettysburg on June 28th, General John B. Gordon, of
Lee&rsquo;s army, went on to York and Wrightsville before returning on July 1st. In his
&ldquo;Reminiscences of the Gettysburg Campaign&rdquo; he tells the following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We entered the city of York on Sunday morning. Halting on the main street,
where the sidewalks were densely packed, I rode a few rods in advance of my troops,
in order to speak to the people from my horse. As I checked him and turned my
full dust-begrimed face upon a bevy of ladies very near me, a cry of alarm came
from their midst; but after a few words of assurance from me, quiet and apparent
confidence were restored. I assured these ladies that the troops behind me, though
ill-clad and travel-stained, were good men and brave; that beneath their rough
exteriors were hearts as loyal to women as ever beat in the breasts of honorable
men; that their own experience and the experience of their mothers, wives, and
sisters at home had taught them how painful must be the sight of a hostile army
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
in their town; that under the orders of the Confederate commander-in-chief both
private property and non-combatants were safe; that the spirit of vengeance and
of rapine had no place in the bosoms of these dust-covered but knightly men; and
I closed by pledging to York the head of any soldier under my command who
destroyed private property, disturbed the repose of a single home, or insulted
a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we moved along the street after this episode, a little girl, probably twelve
years of age, ran up to my horse and handed me a large bouquet of flowers in the
center of which was a note in delicate handwriting, purporting to give the numbers
and describe the position of the Union forces of Wrightsville, toward which I was
advancing. I carefully read and reread this strange note. It bore no signature and
contained no assurance of sympathy for the Southern cause, but it was so terse
and explicit in its terms as to compel my confidence. The second day we were in front
of Wrightsville, and from the high ridge on which this note suggested that I halt
and examine the position of the Union troops, I eagerly scanned the prospect with
my field-glasses, in order to verify the truth of the mysterious communication or
detect its misrepresentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, in full view of us, was the town, just as described, nestling on the
banks of the Susquehanna. There was the blue line of soldiers guarding the approach,
drawn up, as indicated, along an intervening ridge and across the pike.
There was the long bridge spanning the Susquehanna and connecting the town with
Columbia on the other bank. Most important of all, there was the deep gorge or
ravine running off to the right and extending around the left bank of the Federal
line and to the river below the bridge. Not an inaccurate detail in that note could
be discovered. I did not hesitate, therefore, to adopt its suggestion of moving
down the gorge in order to throw my command on the flank, or possibly in the
rear of the Union troops, and force them to a rapid retreat or surrender. The result
of this movement vindicated the strategic wisdom of my unknown and&mdash;judging
by the handwriting&mdash;woman correspondent, whose note was none the less martial
because embedded in roses, and whose evident genius for war, had occasion offered,
might have made her a captain equal to Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The Flag of the 16th Maine</h4>
<p>A marker showing the position of the 16th Maine Infantry Regiment on the
afternoon of the first day&rsquo;s battle stands at the intersection of Doubleday Avenue
and the Mummasburg Road, and contains the following inscription:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Position Held July 1, 1863, at 4 o&rsquo;Clock P.M.
<br />by the 16th Maine Infantry
<br />1st Brig., 2nd Div., 1st Corps</span></p>
<p><span class="small">WHILE THE REST OF THE DIVISION WAS RETIRING, THE
REGIMENT HAVING MOVED FROM THE POSITION AT THE
LEFT WHERE ITS MONUMENT STANDS, UNDER ORDERS
TO HOLD THIS POSITION AT ANY COST.</span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">It Lost on This Field
<br />Killed 11, Wounded 62, Captured 159
<br />Out of 275 Engaged.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When almost surrounded, the regiment withdrew to the left of the railroad cut
to help cover the withdrawal of Stewart&rsquo;s battery, which was also almost surrounded.
The regiment had two flags, the Stars and Stripes and the flag of Maine.</p>
<p>Finally, assaulted by the flank and rear, they determined not to surrender their
colors, but tore them from their staffs and into small bits, each man taking a star
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
or a bit of silk which he placed in his pocket. Some of these fragments were carried
through the southern prisons and finally home to Maine, where they are still
treasured as precious relics by the relatives and friends of the brave men of the
regiment.</p>
<h4>The Barlow-Gordon Incident</h4>
<p>Barlow&rsquo;s Knoll, a short distance northeast of Gettysburg, is named in honor
of Brigadier-General Francis C. Barlow, in command of the 1st Division of the
11th Corps. In his &ldquo;Reminiscences of the Civil War,&rdquo; General Gordon describes
his meeting with Barlow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Returning from the banks of the Susquehanna, and meeting at Gettysburg,
July 1, 1863, the advance of Lee&rsquo;s forces, my command was thrown quickly and
squarely on the right flank of the Union Army. A more timely arrival never occurred.
The battle had been raging for four or five hours. The Confederate General
Archer, with a large part of his brigade, had been captured. Heth and Scales, Confederate
generals, had been wounded. The ranking Union officer on the field,
General Reynolds, had been killed, and General Hancock was assigned to command.
The battle, upon the issue of which hung, perhaps, the fate of the Confederacy,
was in full blast. The Union forces, at first driven back, now re&euml;nforced, were
again advancing and pressing back Lee&rsquo;s left and threatening to envelop it. The
Confederates were stubbornly contesting every foot of ground, but the Southern
left was slowly yielding. A few moments more and the day&rsquo;s battle might have
been ended by a complete turning of Lee&rsquo;s flank. I was ordered to move at once
to the aid of the heavily pressed Confederates. With a ringing yell, my command
rushed upon the line posted to protect the Union right. Here occurred a hand-to-hand
struggle. That protecting Union line, once broken, left my command not
only on the right flank, but obliquely in rear of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any troops that were ever marshalled would, under like conditions, have
been as surely and swiftly shattered. Under the concentrated fire from front and
flank, the marvel is that they escaped. In the midst of the wild disorder in his
ranks, and through a storm of bullets, a Union officer was seeking to rally his men
for a final stand. He, too, went down pierced by a minie ball. Riding forward with
my rapidly advancing lines, I discovered that brave officer lying upon his back,
with the July sun pouring its rays into his pale face. He was surrounded by the
Union dead, and his own life seemed to be rapidly ebbing out. Quickly I dismounted
and lifted his head. I gave him water from my canteen, and asked his name and
the character of his wounds. He was Major-General Francis C. Barlow, of New
York, and of Howard&rsquo;s Corps. The ball had entered his body in front and passed
out near the spinal cord, paralyzing him in legs and arms. Neither of us had the
remotest thought that he could survive many hours. I summoned several soldiers
who were looking after the wounded, and directed them to place him upon a litter
and carry him to the shade in the rear. Before parting, he asked me to take from
his pocket a package of letters and destroy them. They were from his wife. He
had one request to make of me. That request was that, if I lived to the
end of the war and ever met Mrs. Barlow, I would tell her of our meeting on the
field of Gettysburg and his thoughts of her in his last moments. He wished to
assure me that he died doing his duty at the front, that he was willing to give his
life for his country, and that his deepest regret was that he must die without looking
upon her face again. I learned that Mrs. Barlow was with the Union Army,
and near the battlefield. When it is remembered how closely Mrs. Gordon followed
me, it will not be difficult to realize that my sympathies were especially stirred by the
announcement that his wife was so near to him. Passing through the day&rsquo;s battle
unhurt, I despatched, at its close, under a flag of truce, the promised message to
Mrs. Barlow. I assured her that she should have safe escort to her husband&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the desperate encounters of the two succeeding days, and the retreat of
Lee&rsquo;s army, I thought no more of Barlow, except to number him with the noble
dead of the two armies who have so gloriously met their fate. The ball, however,
had struck no vital point, and Barlow slowly recovered, though his fate was unknown
to me. The following summer, in battles near Richmond, my kinsman with
the same initials, General J. B. Gordon of North Carolina, was killed. Barlow,
who had recovered, saw the announcement of his death, and entertained no doubt
that he was the Gordon whom he had met on the field of Gettysburg. To me,
therefore, Barlow was dead; to Barlow I was dead. Nearly fifteen years passed
before either of us was undeceived. During my second term in the United States
Senate, the Hon. Clarkson Potter of New York was the member of the House of
Representatives. He invited me to dinner in Washington to meet a General Barlow
who had served in the Union Army. Potter knew nothing of the Gettysburg
incident. I had heard that there was another Barlow in the Union Army, and supposed
of course, that it was this Barlow with whom I was to dine. Barlow had a
similar reflection as to the Gordon he was to meet. Seated at Clarkson Potter&rsquo;s
table, I asked Barlow: &lsquo;General, are you related to the Barlow who was killed at
Gettysburg?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;Why, I am the man, sir. Are you related to the Gordon
who killed me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am the man, sir,&rsquo; I responded. No words of mine can convey
any conception of the emotions awakened by these startling announcements.
Nothing short of an actual resurrection of the dead could have amazed either of us
more. Thenceforward, until his untimely death in 1896, the friendship between us
which was born amidst the thunders of Gettysburg was cherished by both.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>General Ewell Is Hit by a Bullet</h4>
<p>General Gordon gives an account of an amusing incident of the first day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late in the afternoon of this first day&rsquo;s battle, when the firing had greatly
decreased along most of the lines, General Ewell and I were riding through the
streets of Gettysburg. In a previous battle he had lost one of his legs, but prided
himself on the efficiency of the wooden one which he used in its place. As we rode
together, a body of Union soldiers, posted behind some dwellings and fences on the
outskirts of the town, suddenly opened a brisk fire. A number of Confederates
were killed or wounded, and I heard the ominous thud of a minie ball as it struck
General Ewell at my side. I quickly asked: &lsquo;Are you hurt, sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he replied;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not hurt. But suppose that ball had struck you: we would have had the
trouble of carrying you off the field, sir. You see how much better fixed I am for a
fight than you are. It don&rsquo;t hurt a bit to be shot in a wooden leg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ewell was a most interesting and eccentric character. It is said that in his
early manhood he had been disappointed in a love affair, and had never fully
recovered from its effects. The fair maiden to whom he had given his affections
had married another man; but Ewell, like the truest of knights, carried her image
in his heart through long years. When he was promoted to the rank of brigadier or
major-general, he evidenced the constancy of his affections by placing upon his
staff the son of the woman whom he had loved in his youth. The meddlesome
Fates, who seem to revel in the romances of lovers, had decreed that Ewell
should be shot in battle and become the object of solicitude and tender
nursing by this lady, Mrs. Brown, who had been for many years a widow.
Her gentle ministrations soothed his weary weeks of suffering, a marriage
ensued, and with it came the realization of Ewell&rsquo;s long-deferred hope. He
was a most devoted husband. He never seemed to realize, however, that
marriage had changed her name, for he proudly presented her to his friends as
&lsquo;My wife, Mrs. Brown, sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h4>The School Teachers&rsquo; Regiment</h4>
<p>The 151st Pennsylvania Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George
F. McFarland, included Company D, made up mainly of the instructors and
students of the Lost Creek Academy, of McAlisterville, Juniata County, of which
Colonel McFarland was principal. For this reason it was called the &ldquo;Schoolteachers&rsquo;
Regiment.&rdquo; The material throughout was excellent, many of the men
being experienced marksmen. The regiment went into battle with 21 officers and
446 men, and sustained a loss in killed, wounded, and missing of 337, or over
75 per cent.</p>
<p>The casualties of the 26th North Carolina Regiment, against which they were
engaged, were 588 out of 800, just about the same percentage.</p>
<p>Colonel McFarland lost his right leg and had the left permanently disabled,
but survived until 1891. On the twenty-fifth anniversary of the battle, he
delivered the dedicatory address at the unveiling of the regimental monument,
exactly twenty-five years to the hour after his engagement in battle.</p>
<h4>An Incident of the First Day</h4>
<p>An incident, similar to that described by Browning in his poem &ldquo;An Incident
of the French Camp,&rdquo; occurred at the railroad cut early on the first day.</p>
<p>An officer of the 6th Wisconsin Regiment, active in the capture of the Mississippians
belonging to the 2nd and 42nd Regiments, who had taken shelter in the railroad
cut after turning the right of Cutler&rsquo;s line, approached Colonel Rufus R.
Dawes after the engagement was over. Colonel Dawes supposed, from the erect
appearance of the man, that he had come for further orders, but his compressed
lips told a different story. With great effort the officer said: &ldquo;Tell them at home
I died like a man and a soldier.&rdquo; He then opened his coat, showed a ghastly wound
on his breast, and dropped dead.</p>

<h2 id="c6">THE SECOND DAY</h2>
<p>The scene of the engagements of the second and third days
shifted to the south and southeast of Gettysburg. General
Meade arrived on the field from his headquarters at Taneytown,
Md., at 1 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, July 2nd, and established his headquarters at
the Leister House, on the Taneytown Road, in rear of the line of the
2nd Corps. As soon as it was light he inspected the position already
occupied and made arrangements for posting the several corps as
they should reach the ground.</p>
<h3>The Union Line of Battle.</h3>
<p>Starting on the right with Slocum&rsquo;s 12th Corps, Williams&rsquo;
Division extended from Rock Creek by way of Spangler&rsquo;s Spring
to Culp&rsquo;s Hill, with Geary&rsquo;s Division on the hill. The line between
Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Cemetery Hill was held by Wadsworth&rsquo;s Division
of the 1st Corps. Barlow&rsquo;s Division of the 11th Corps under Ames
was located at the foot of East Cemetery Hill. Carman, Colgrove,
Slocum, Geary, and Wainwright avenues follow these lines of
battle.</p>
<p>On Cemetery Hill, across the Baltimore Pike, the line was
held by Schurz and on his left Steinwehr, both of the 11th Corps.
Robinson&rsquo;s Division of the 1st Corps extended across the Taneytown
Road to Ziegler&rsquo;s Grove. Beyond lay Hancock&rsquo;s 2nd Corps,
with the Divisions of Hays, Gibbon, and Caldwell from right to
left. To the left of Hancock, Sickles&rsquo; 3rd Corps, consisting of the
Divisions of Humphreys and Birney, prolonged the line to the
vicinity of Little Round Top. Beginning at the Taneytown Road,
Hancock and Sedgwick avenues follow these lines of battle.</p>
<p>Arriving later in the day, the 5th Corps, under General Sykes,
was posted on the Baltimore Pike, at the Rock Creek crossing.
Later it occupied the ground about Round Top to the left of the
3rd Corps. The 6th Corps, under General Sedgwick, reaching the
field still later after a march of over 30 miles, was posted in
reserve back of Round Top, from which position portions were
moved as circumstances demanded. The lines held by the 5th and
6th Corps coincide with Sykes, Ayres, Wright, and Howe Avenues.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/img011.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="408" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Stevens&rsquo; Knoll.</span>&mdash;Arriving on Stevens&rsquo; Knoll at the end of the first day,
General Slocum brought supporting troops. The lunettes
protecting the cannon remain intact.</p>
</div>
<p>Gamble&rsquo;s and Devin&rsquo;s brigades of Buford&rsquo;s Cavalry, which had
had an active part in the battle of the first day, were on the left
between Cemetery and Seminary Ridges until 10 <span class="small">A.M.</span> when they
were ordered, by some mistake, to move to Westminster, Md.,
before the arrival of Gregg&rsquo;s Division on its way from Hanover,
and Merritt&rsquo;s brigade of Buford&rsquo;s Division from Mechanicsburg
(now Thurmont), Md.</p>
<p>General Meade&rsquo;s line, shaped like a fishhook, was about 3 miles
long. The right faced east, the center over Cemetery Hill, north,
and the left from Cemetery Hill to Round Top nearly west. The
whole line was supported by artillery brigades belonging to the
different corps.</p>
<h3>Confederate Line of Battle.</h3>
<p>General Lee&rsquo;s line was nearly the same shape as General Meade&rsquo;s
but, being the outer line, was about 6 miles long. On the right,
facing the two Round Tops, were Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions
of Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps. On the left of McLaws, extending along
the line of Seminary Ridge, were the Divisions of Anderson and
Pender of Hill&rsquo;s Corps, with Heth&rsquo;s Division in the rear in reserve.
On the left of Pender, extending through the town along the line
of West Middle Street, was Rodes&rsquo; Division of Ewell&rsquo;s Corps, then
Early&rsquo;s and Johnson&rsquo;s Divisions, the latter reaching to Benner&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Hill, east of Rock Creek. Pickett&rsquo;s Division of Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps
was at Chambersburg, guarding trains, and Law&rsquo;s Brigade of
Hood&rsquo;s Division of Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps at New Guilford, guarding
the rear. The latter arrived at noon on the 2nd in time to participate
in the day&rsquo;s engagement. Pickett&rsquo;s Division arrived later
and was not engaged until the afternoon of the 3rd. The artillery
was posted according to the different corps to which it was attached.</p>
<p>General Lee&rsquo;s line coincides with the present West Confederate
Avenue along Seminary and Warfield or Snyder Ridges, west of the
town, then runs through the town to coincide with East Confederate
Avenue. The distance between the Union and Confederate
lines is three-fourths of a mile to a mile.</p>
<p>Military critics agree that General Meade held the stronger
position. Both flanks presented precipitous and rocky fronts,
difficult to attack, and it was possible to send reinforcements by
short distances from point to point.</p>
<h3>Sickles&rsquo; Change of Line.</h3>
<p>As already stated, General Sickles&rsquo; 3rd Corps was on the left
of General Hancock&rsquo;s 2nd Corps on Cemetery Ridge, and Birney&rsquo;s
Division was near the base of Little Round Top, replacing Geary&rsquo;s
Division after its withdrawal to be posted on Culp&rsquo;s Hill.
Humphreys&rsquo; Division was on low ground to the right between
Cemetery Ridge and the Emmitsburg Road.</p>
<p>Anxious to know what was in his front, Sickles sent the Berdan
Sharpshooters and the 3rd Maine Infantry forward on a reconnaissance.
On reaching the Pitzer Woods, beyond the Emmitsburg
Road, they found the Confederates there in force, and after a
sharp engagement with Wilcox&rsquo;s Brigade, withdrew and reported.</p>
<p>Believing that Lee planned a flank movement on his line, and
that the Emmitsburg Road afforded better positions for the
artillery, Sickles moved his Corps forward and posted Humphreys&rsquo;
Division on the right along the Emmitsburg Road and his left
extending to the Peach Orchard. Birney&rsquo;s Division prolonged the
line from the Peach Orchard across the Wheatfield to Devil&rsquo;s Den.
This new line formed a salient at the Peach Orchard and therefore
presented two fronts, one to the west, the other to the south.</p>
<p>About 3 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Sickles was called to General Meade&rsquo;s headquarters
to a conference of corps commanders. Upon the sound of
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
artillery, the conference adjourned, and Meade, Sickles, and
Warren, Meade&rsquo;s Chief Engineer, rode to inspect Sickles&rsquo; change
of line. The artillery was already engaged, and believing it too late
to make any changes since the enemy was present, Meade decided
to attempt to hold the new
position by sending in supports.
After reviewing the new
line, General Warren left the
other members of the party
and rode up Little Round Top.
He found the height unoccupied
except by the personnel
of a signal station.</p>

</div>
<h3>General Lee&rsquo;s Plan.</h3>
<p>Lee as well as Meade occupied
the forenoon in the arrangement
of his line of battle.
After a conference with Ewell,
he decided to attack Meade&rsquo;s
left. In his report, Lee says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It was determined to make the
principal attack upon the enemy&rsquo;s
left, and endeavor to gain a position
from which it was thought that our
artillery could be brought to bear with effect. Longstreet was directed to place
the division of McLaws and Hood on the right of Hill, partially enveloping
the enemy&rsquo;s left, which he was to drive in.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>General Hill was ordered to threaten the enemy&rsquo;s center to prevent reinforcements
being drawn to either wing, and co&ouml;perate with his right division
in Longstreet&rsquo;s attack.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>General Ewell was instructed to make a simultaneous demonstration upon
the enemy&rsquo;s right, to be converted into a real attack should opportunity offer.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When General Lee arranged this plan of attack he believed
Meade&rsquo;s left terminated at the Peach Orchard; he did not know
that Sickles&rsquo; advance line extended to the left from the salient
at the Peach Orchard to Devil&rsquo;s Den. In plain view of the Union
signal station on Little Round Top, some of his forces were compelled
to make a wide detour via the Black Horse Tavern on the
Fairfield Road in order to avoid observation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h3>Little Round Top.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, General Warren on Little Round Top saw the
importance of the hill as a tactical position on Meade&rsquo;s left. The
signal officers were preparing to leave; he ordered them to remain
and to keep waving their flags so as to lead the Confederates to
believe that the hill was occupied. He dispatched a messenger to
Devil&rsquo;s Den, where a Union battery was posted, with an order that
a shot be fired to produce confusion in the woods in front, through
which Hood&rsquo;s forces were supposed to be advancing. Seeing the
reflection of the sunlight from Confederate muskets, he realized that
if this important position were to be held, it would be necessary
to get troops there without delay.</p>
<p>Quickly he sent a member of his staff to Sickles for troops.
Sickles said none could be spared. Warren sent another staff
officer to Meade, who immediately ordered Sykes to move his
Corps to Little Round Top. Barnes&rsquo; Division of this Corps had
already been called for by Sickles to defend his line, and three
brigades, Vincent&rsquo;s, Tilton&rsquo;s, and Sweitzer&rsquo;s, were moving toward
the Wheatfield. Learning of the need of troops on Little Round
Top, Vincent moved back, skirted the east side of Little Round
Top, and went into position between Little and Big Round Top,
arriving just before the Confederates from Hood&rsquo;s right advanced
over Big Round Top.</p>
<p>Having watched these movements, Warren rode down to the
crossing of what is now Sykes Avenue and the Wheatfield Road.
There he met Colonel O&rsquo;Rorke, in command of the 140th New
York, and ordered his regiment, together with Hazlett&rsquo;s battery,
to the crest of the hill. With the addition of Weed&rsquo;s Brigade, the
combined forces held the Round Tops. There was a desperate
engagement in which both contestants displayed courage of a very
high order. The Union soldiers were victorious, and Meade&rsquo;s left
was secured against further attack.</p>
<h3>The Peach Orchard and the Wheatfield.</h3>
<p>After the struggle for the possession of Little Round Top, the
other Confederate brigades of Hood and McLaws advanced
rapidly. A lack of coordination in their movement allowed Meade
to bring up supports. Three brigades of Anderson&rsquo;s Division of
Hill&rsquo;s Corps advanced against Humphreys&rsquo; line, in the following
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
order: Wilcox, Perry, Wright. Wounded, General Pender was unable
to direct Posey and Mahone in support of Wright, and Wright
was obliged to withdraw. Humphreys was compelled to change
front in order to meet the assault on his flanks. This maneuver
served to stay the Confederate attack for a brief time. The Valley
of Death between the Round Tops and the opposite height was now
a seething mass of opposing forces, enshrouded in clouds of smoke.</p>
<p>Meade had already depleted his right to support his left by
withdrawing all of Slocum&rsquo;s 12th Corps except Greene&rsquo;s Brigade.
He now sent all of the 5th Corps to the left and ordered Caldwell&rsquo;s
Division from the left of Hancock&rsquo;s 2nd Corps south of the Angle
to the Wheatfield. Willard&rsquo;s Brigade on Hays&rsquo; line of the 2nd Corps
was ordered to advance and oppose the Confederate, Barksdale,
who, after crossing the Emmitsburg Road north of the Peach
Orchard and the field beyond, reached Watson&rsquo;s Union battery
posted on the Trostle farm. General Sickles was severely and
Barksdale mortally wounded.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Wheatfield.</span>&mdash;Scene of carnage on the second day</p>
</div>
<p>Wofford&rsquo;s Brigade of McLaws&rsquo; Division broke through the
salient at the Peach Orchard and reached the valley between
Devil&rsquo;s Den and Little Round Top, where they were met by a
charge of the Pennsylvania Reserves of Crawford&rsquo;s Division, led
by McCandless, some of whose men fought in sight of their own
homes. Wofford was obliged to withdraw to and beyond the Wheatfield;
the Reserves advanced across the valley from their position
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
on the north of Little Round Top and reached the stone wall on
the east side of the Wheatfield. Here they remained until after
Pickett&rsquo;s charge on the 3rd, when they advanced against the Confederates
who had succeeded in regaining control of that part
of the field.</p>
<p>About the time when Sickles was wounded, Meade directed
Hancock to assume command of Sickles&rsquo; Corps in addition to his
own. Meade in person led Lockwood&rsquo;s brigade, brought from the
extreme right, against the Confederate advance. Newton, now in
command of the 1st Corps, sent in Doubleday&rsquo;s Division. With
these troops Hancock checked the advance of the Confederate
brigades of Barksdale, Wilcox, Perry, and Wright, while Sykes
checked the advance of Hood and McLaws. Brigades of the 6th
Corps reached the field toward the close of the engagement. Withdrawing
from the Wheatfield Road, Bigelow&rsquo;s battery made a
determined stand at the Trostle buildings and succeeded in checking
the Confederate advance until the gap on Sickles&rsquo; first line
was protected by a line of guns. Most of the Confederate brigades
got no farther than Plum Run, except Wright&rsquo;s, which actually
reached the line of guns on Hancock&rsquo;s front before it was obliged
to withdraw.</p>
<p>During the repulse of the Confederate advance, the 1st Minnesota
regiment of Harrow&rsquo;s Brigade of Gibbon&rsquo;s Division of
Hancock&rsquo;s Corps was ordered by Hancock to oppose Wilcox&rsquo;s and
Perry&rsquo;s Brigades, rapidly advancing against Hancock&rsquo;s left. The
Minnesota regiment moved up at once and succeeded in repelling
the attack, but only after losing 82 per cent of its men.</p>
<p>Though seriously threatened, Meade&rsquo;s line held, and after the
repulse of Wright, the attack ended. During the night the line
was prolonged to the top of Big Round Top. The Confederates
remained west of Plum Run, except at Big Round Top, where
they intrenched along the western slope.</p>
<h3>Ewell&rsquo;s Attack on Meade&rsquo;s Right.</h3>
<p>Ordered by Lee to begin his attack on Meade&rsquo;s right at the
same time as Longstreet&rsquo;s attack on Meade&rsquo;s left, Ewell&rsquo;s artillery
on Benner&rsquo;s Hill opened fire on Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Cemetery
Hill where the Union forces were posted and well protected
with earthworks. On account of the destructive fire from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Union batteries on East Cemetery Hill, Ewell lost most of his
guns, and no infantry advance was made until Longstreet&rsquo;s
assault had ended. At sundown General Johnson&rsquo;s infantry
advanced against Culp&rsquo;s Hill, General Early against East Cemetery
Hill. Rodes, who was
directed to move against West
Cemetery Hill, was unable to
obey instructions. General
Walker, who had been sent
east to Brinkerhoff Ridge in
the forenoon, to guard Ewell&rsquo;s
flank, and who was expected
to assist in this attack, was
prevented by meeting part of
the Union cavalry of Gregg&rsquo;s
Division that had arrived via
Hanover on the forenoon of
the 2nd. After an engagement
with Gregg, Walker moved
up to assist Johnson, but too
late to be of service, as the
attack on Culp&rsquo;s Hill had
ended.</p>
<p>The attack was conducted
with the greatest dash and
daring, in part up rough slopes
of woodland over heaped
boulders. On East Cemetery Hill the fight among the Union
guns was hand to hand, and clubbed muskets, stones, and
rammers were used to drive back the assailants. After sunset
a bright moon illuminated the field. The Union troops stood
firm, and at 10 o&rsquo;clock the Confederates desisted, having captured
only a few Union entrenchments.</p>

</div>
<h3>Situation at End of the Second Day.</h3>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s assaults on Meade&rsquo;s left had failed to accomplish anything
decisive. While Sickles&rsquo; advance-line was driven back
and most of the field, including the Peach Orchard, the Wheatfield,
Devil&rsquo;s Den, and the base of Big Round Top, was occupied
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
by the Confederates, Meade&rsquo;s line was practically intact from
the crest of Big Round Top on the left to near Spangler&rsquo;s Spring
on the right. On the slopes of Round Top, on Cemetery Hill
and Culp&rsquo;s Hill, the advantage of the defensive positions multiplied
the forces of the defenders in comparison with the attackers
at least three to one. Prodigious deeds of valor were performed
by both armies, and courage of the highest order was displayed
in attack and in the defense. Casualties were very heavy on both
sides. Meade estimated that his losses were 65 per cent of the
total for the three days. At the end of the day he made the
following report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>July 2, 1863, 8</i> <span class="small">P.M.</span> <i>The enemy attacked me about 4</i> <span class="small">P.M.</span> <i>this day, and,
after one of the severest contests of the war, was repulsed at all points. We have
suffered considerably in killed and wounded. Among the former are Brigadier
Generals Paul and Zook, and among the wounded are Generals Sickles,
Barlow, Graham, and Warren slightly. We have taken a large number of
prisoners. I shall remain in my present position tomorrow, but am not prepared
to say, until better advised of the condition of the army, whether my
operations will be of an offensive or defensive character.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the night, at a council of war held by Meade with his
corps commanders&mdash;Gibbon, Williams, Sykes, Newton, Howard,
Hancock, Sedgwick and Slocum&mdash;sentiment favored remaining and
fighting a defensive battle. As Lee attacked both wings of Meade&rsquo;s
line on the 2nd it was expected that if another attack were made it
would be on the center. This expectation was correct&mdash;Wright&rsquo;s
attack on the 2nd, when he succeeded in reaching Meade&rsquo;s line south
of the Angle, led Lee to believe that this was the most vulnerable
point.</p>
<p>General Lee had more definite plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The result of this day&rsquo;s operations induced the belief that, with proper
concert of action, and with the increased support that the positions gained on
the right would enable the artillery to render the assaulting column, we should
ultimately succeed, and it was accordingly determined to continue the attack.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general plan was unchanged. Longstreet, re-enforced by
Pickett&rsquo;s three brigades, which arrived near the battlefield during
the afternoon of the 2nd, was ordered to attack the next morning,
and General Ewell was directed to assail the enemy&rsquo;s right at the
same time. The latter, during the night, re-enforced General
Johnson with three brigades from Rodes&rsquo; and Early&rsquo;s Divisions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c7">INCIDENTS OF THE SECOND DAY</h2>
<h4>The Roger House</h4>
<p>The Roger House is located on the west side of the Emmitsburg Road, about a
mile south of Gettysburg, midway between Meade&rsquo;s line of battle on Cemetery
Ridge and Lee&rsquo;s line on Seminary Ridge. On the afternoon of July 2nd, after
Sickles advanced his corps from its first position to the Emmitsburg Road, it was
surrounded by the right of the new line. The 1st Massachusetts Regiment, whose
monument stands adjacent to the house, held this part of the line, and was hotly
engaged when the brigades of Wilcox and Wright advanced during the assault of
Longstreet on the Union left on the afternoon of the 2nd. During Pickett&rsquo;s Charge,
on the afternoon of the 3rd, the house was again surrounded by fighting men.</p>
<p>While the battle raged on all sides, a granddaughter of the owner, Miss Josephine
Miller, remained, and, notwithstanding the great danger, baked bread and biscuits
for the hungry soldiers. In 1896, Miss Miller, then Mrs. Slyder, paid a visit to her
old home, and related the following story of her experience to Mr. Wilfred Pearse,
of Boston, Mass., a visitor to Gettysburg at the same time. After his return he
published the following article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The veterans of the 1st Massachusetts Infantry Regiment will be glad to
learn that the only woman member of the 3rd Army Corps &lsquo;Veterans&rsquo; Association,&rsquo;
Mrs. Slyder, n&eacute;e Miss Josephine Miller, granddaughter of farmer Roger, owner of
the farm near which the 1st Massachusetts monument stands, is visiting her old
home on the battleground where she stood from sunrise to sunset for two days of
the battle making hot biscuits for the Boys in Blue. She refused to take money for
the bread, and refused to stop her work even when Confederate shells were bursting
around the house. She told me the other day that when her stock of flour was almost
exhausted six members of the 1st Massachusetts kindly volunteered to go out and
steal three sacks of flour from General Sickles&rsquo; commissary stores. In an hour&rsquo;s
time they returned with flour, raisins, currants, and a whole sheep, with which
a rattling good meal was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old range still stands in the kitchen, and in it, at the last reunion of the
3rd Corps, Mrs. Slyder cooked a dinner for General Sickles.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Spangler&rsquo;s Spring</h4>
<p>This spring, which takes its name from Abraham Spangler, its owner at the
time of the battle, is located at the southeast corner of Culp&rsquo;s Hill. Inasmuch as it
was used by soldiers of both armies during the battle, and since then by thousands
of tourists, it is an interesting feature of the field. Only during the drought of 1930
has it failed to give forth a copious flow of cool, pure water. At the time of the
battle it was surrounded by a wall of flat stones with a flagstone cover over the top.
These were removed and a canopy top erected.</p>
<p>The 12th Corps of the Army of the Potomac occupied this part of Meade&rsquo;s
line on the night of the first day and until the afternoon of the 2nd, when the
troops were ordered to the left to help repel Longstreet&rsquo;s assault. Until this time
the spring was used only by the Union troops. During their absence, the Confederates
under Johnson moved up and took possession of part of the vacated line.
In the early morning of the third day, the Union forces, who had returned from
the left during the night of the 2nd, attacked Johnson, drove him out and succeeded
in regaining possession of the line that had been vacated by them on the afternoon
of the 2nd, including the spring.</p>
<p>The story that a truce was entered into between the opposing forces on the
night of the 2nd and that they met in large numbers at the spring to get water is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
mistake. The captured and wounded of the Union forces were allowed access to it
along with the Confederates who were there at the time, but there was no truce.
When armies were encamped, pickets from the opposing lines would sometimes get
together, usually to trade coffee and tobacco, but this was never done when a battle
was in progress.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/img015.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="414" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Spangler&rsquo;s Spring.</span>&mdash;Spangler&rsquo;s Spring was used first by the Union, then by the
Confederate troops, and since by thousands of tourists</p>
</div>
<p>The following extract from the address of Captain Joseph Matchett at the
dedication of the monument erected by the 46th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment,
shows that there was no truce:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time in the night (2nd), we were ordered to return to our works on Culp&rsquo;s
Hill. It seems Captain Selfridge of Company H had taken some of his men&rsquo;s
canteens and gone ahead to Spangler&rsquo;s Spring to fill them, when he discovered
&lsquo;Johnnies&rsquo; also filling their canteens. He backed out with the best grace he could
command, and reported it to the colonel. Colonel McDougall, the brigade commander,
did not believe it and got very angry, but the colonel of the regiment
insisted on deploying his men, and sent a skirmish line, who found the enemy as
stated and saved many lives.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Colonel Avery&rsquo;s Lost Grave</h4>
<p>Among those who faced death in the desperate charge on the Union right on
East Cemetery Hill, July 2nd, Colonel I. E. Avery, of North Carolina, in command of
Hoke&rsquo;s brigade, bore a gallant part. At the head of the column he led his men up
the slope of Cemetery Hill and, a conspicuous mark, fell mortally wounded.</p>
<p>Unable to speak, he drew a card from his pocket and wrote the following: &ldquo;Tell
father that I died with my face toward the enemy.&rdquo; In the retreat from Gettysburg,
his body was taken along to be delivered to his family, but when the army reached
Williamsport the Potomac was too high to cross. There, in the cemetery overlooking
the river, the remains were interred in an oak coffin under a pine tree. He was
buried in his uniform by the men who saw him fall.</p>
<p>Thirty years after, Judge A. C. Avery, of the Supreme Court of North Carolina,
a resident of Morgantown, and Captain J. A. McPherson of Fayette, N. C., both
veterans of the Confederacy, came to Williamsport with the object of locating
Colonel Avery&rsquo;s grave. Their search was fruitless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h4>The Leister House</h4>
<p>On his arrival, General Meade established his headquarters at the Leister House,
one of the oldest houses in the community, located at the intersection of Meade
Avenue and the Taneytown Road. At the time of the battle it was the property of
a widow, Mrs. Leister. It now belongs to the Government, and a bronze plate
marks it as Meade&rsquo;s Headquarters. It is built of logs, chinked and weatherboarded
with rough pine boards, pierced by bullet-holes and scarred by shells.</p>
<p>Inside there are two rooms, a small kitchen at the west, and a larger room at the
east. In the latter, Meade held a council of war after the battle of the 2nd had
ended, summoning his Corps commanders between 9 and 10 o&rsquo;clock to consult
them as to what action, if any, should be taken on the 3rd. Generals Sedgwick,
Slocum, Hancock, Howard, Sykes, Newton, Birney, Williams, and Gibbon were
present. The following questions were asked:</p>
<p>(1) Under existing circumstances is it advisable for this army to remain in its
present position, or to retire to another nearer its base of supplies?</p>
<p>(2) It being determined to remain in present position, shall the army attack or
wait the attack of the enemy?</p>
<p>(3) If we wait attack, how long?</p>
<p><i>Replies</i>:</p>
<p>Gibbon: (1) Correct position of the army, but would not retreat. (2) In no
condition to attack, in his opinion. (3) Until he moves.</p>
<p>Williams: (1) Stay. (2) Wait attack. (3) One day.</p>
<p>Birney and Sykes: Same as General Williams.</p>
<p>Newton: (1) Correct position of the army, but would not retreat. (2) By all
means not attack. (3) If we wait it will give them a chance to cut our line.</p>
<p>Howard: (1) Remain. (2) Wait attack until 4 <span class="small">P.M.</span> tomorrow. (3) If don&rsquo;t
attack, attack them.</p>
<p>Hancock: (1) Rectify position without moving so as to give up field. (2) Not
attack unless our communications are cut. (3) Can&rsquo;t wait long; can&rsquo;t be idle.</p>
<p>Sedgwick: (1) Remain. (2) Wait attack. (3) At least one day.</p>
<p>Slocum: (1) Stay and fight it out.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion of the council was to stay and await attack. Just as
the council broke up, General Meade said to Gibbon, &ldquo;If Lee attacks tomorrow, it
will be on your front. He has made attacks on both our flanks and failed, and if he
concludes to try it again it will be on our center.&rdquo; The attack of Lee on the 3rd
was made where Meade expected.</p>
<p>During the forenoon of the third day, conditions at headquarters were generally
quiet. In the afternoon, when the Confederate artillery on Seminary Ridge opened
fire as a prelude to Pickett&rsquo;s Charge, it was directed mainly against the left center
of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. As the location of Meade&rsquo;s headquarters
was in the immediate rear, just under the crest of the ridge, much damage was done
by the hail of shot and shell that crossed the ridge. A shell exploded in the yard
among the staff officers&rsquo; horses tied to the fence, and a number of them were killed,
while still other horses were killed in the rear of the building. Several members of
the headquarters&rsquo; guard were slightly wounded.</p>
<p>George G. Meade, a grandson of General Meade, in his interesting narrative
&ldquo;With Meade at Gettysburg,&rdquo; tells the following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During this rain of Confederate shell, and while Meade, deep in thought, was
walking up and down this little back yard between the house and the Taneytown
Road, he chanced to notice that some of his staff, during the enforced inactivity
while waiting the pleasure of their general, were gradually and probably unconsciously
edging around the side of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; he said, stopping and smiling pleasantly, &lsquo;Are you trying to find
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
a safer place? You remind me of the man who was driving the ox-cart which took
ammunition for the heavy guns on the field of Palo Alto. Finding himself within
range, he tilted up his cart and got behind it. Just then General Taylor came along,
and seeing the attempt at shelter, shouted, &ldquo;You damned fool; don&rsquo;t you know
you are no safer there than anywhere else?&rdquo; The driver replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
I am, General, but it kind o&rsquo; feels so.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the firing still continued it was decided to move the headquarters several
hundred yards south on the Taneytown Road, to a barn on the Cassatt property.
There a Confederate shell exploded and wounded General Butterfield, the chief of
staff, who was obliged to leave the field and was unable to return that day. After
remaining a short time, General Meade and staff removed to General Slocum&rsquo;s
headquarters at Powers&rsquo; Hill, along the Baltimore Pike, moving there by way of
Granite Lane.</p>
<h4>The Louisiana Tigers</h4>
<p>Major Chatham R. Wheat&rsquo;s battalion of Louisiana Infantry was organized in
New Orleans in May, 1861. Their first engagement was in the first battle of Bull
Run, where Major Wheat was shot through both lungs. After his recovery, he
re-entered the service and took an active part in command of the battalion in
the defense of Richmond in 1863 against the advance of the Union forces under
McClellan. During this campaign the battalion became known as &ldquo;The Louisiana
Tigers&rdquo; on account of their desperate fighting qualities. At the battle of Gaines
Mill, Major Wheat and several other leading officers of the battalion were killed,
and the loss of the organization was very heavy. It was then broken up and the
survivors distributed among the other Louisiana regiments, of Hays&rsquo; brigade of
Early&rsquo;s Division, and Nicholls&rsquo; brigade of Johnson&rsquo;s Division of Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. A
number of them were in the battle of Gettysburg with these brigades, but not as
the separate organization originally known as &ldquo;The Louisiana Tigers.&rdquo; This
designation was given to all the Louisiana troops after the original battalion was
discontinued. The story sometimes told, that 1,700 Louisiana Tigers attacked
East Cemetery Hill on July 2nd, that all but 300 were killed or captured, and that
the organization was unknown afterward, is not correct.</p>
<h4>General Meade&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baldy&rdquo;</h4>
<p>In the first great battle of the Civil War, at Bull Run, there was a bright bay
horse with white face and feet. He, as well as his rider, was seriously wounded and
the horse was turned back to the quartermaster to recover. In September General
Meade bought him and named him &ldquo;Baldy.&rdquo; Meade became deeply attached to
the horse but his staff officers soon began to complain of his peculiar racking gait
which was hard to follow. Faster than a walk and slow for a trot, it compelled the
staff alternately to trot and walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baldy&rdquo; was wounded twice at the first battle of Bull Run; he was at the battle of
Drainsville; he took part in two of the seven days&rsquo; fighting around Richmond in the
summer of 1862; he carried his master at Groveton, August 29th; at the second
battle of Bull Run; at South Mountain and at Antietam. In the last battle he was
left on the field for dead, but in the next Federal advance he was discovered quietly
grazing on the battleground with a deep wound in his neck. He was tenderly cared
for and soon was fit for duty. He bore the general at the battles of Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville. For two days he was present at Gettysburg, where he received
his most grievous wound from a bullet entering his body between the ribs and
lodging there. Meade would not part with him and kept him with the army until
the following spring.</p>
<p>In the preparations of the Army of the Potomac for the last campaign, &ldquo;Baldy&rdquo;
was sent to pasture at Downingtown, Pa. After the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Meade hurried to Philadelphia where he again met his faithful charger, fully recovered.
For many years the horse and the general were inseparable companions,
and when Meade died in 1872, &ldquo;Baldy&rdquo; followed the hearse. Ten years later he
died, and his head and two fore-hoofs were mounted and are now cherished relics
of the George G. Meade Post, Grand Army of the Republic, in Philadelphia.</p>
<h4>General Lee&rsquo;s &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo;</h4>
<p>The most famous of the steeds in the stables of General Lee, was &ldquo;Traveller,&rdquo;
an iron-gray horse. He was raised in Greenbriar County, Virginia, near Blue
Sulphur Springs, and as a colt won first prize at a fair in Lewisburg. When hostilities
commenced, Traveller, then called &ldquo;Jeff Davis,&rdquo; was owned by Major Thomas
L. Broun, who had paid $175 in gold for him. In the spring of 1862, Lee bought
him for $200 and changed his name to &ldquo;Traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; was the especial companion of the general. His fine proportions attracted
immediate attention. He was gray in color, with black points, a long mane,
and flowing tail. He stood sixteen hands high, and was five years old in the spring
of 1862. His figure was muscular, with deep chest and short back, strong haunches,
flat legs, small head, quick eyes, broad forehead, and small feet. His rapid, springy
step and bold carriage made him conspicuous. On a long and tedious march he
easily carried Lee&rsquo;s weight at five or six miles an hour without faltering and at the
end of the day&rsquo;s march seemed to be as fresh as at the beginning. The other horses
broke down under the strain and each in turn proved unequal to the rigors of war,
but &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; sturdily withstood the hardships of the campaigns in Virginia,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania. When, in April, 1865, the last battle of the Army
of Northern Virginia had been fought and Lee rode to the McLean House at
Appomattox Court House, he was astride &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; who carried him back to his
waiting army, and then to Richmond. When Lee became a private citizen and
retired to Washington and Lee University as its president, the veteran war-horse
was still with him, and as the years passed and both master and servant neared
life&rsquo;s ending, they became more closely attached. As the funeral cortege accompanied
Lee to his last resting-place, &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; marched behind the hearse. After
&ldquo;Traveller&rsquo;s&rdquo; death, his skeleton was mounted and is on exhibition in the museum
in the chapel on the campus of Washington and Lee University.</p>

conclusion of the attack and defense of Meade&rsquo;s right. His
forces, returning from the left, where they had been sent on
the afternoon of the 2nd, found part of their earthworks in possession
of the enemy. At daybreak preparations were made to recapture
the lost entrenchments. By 10.30 the effort was successful, and
Meade&rsquo;s line was once more intact from end to end.</p>
<h3>Second Battle at Culp&rsquo;s Hill.</h3>
<p>This action on the morning of the 3rd was one of the most
hotly contested of the battle. The Confederate losses in killed
were almost the same as those of Pickett&rsquo;s Division in the attack
on Meade&rsquo;s left center in the afternoon. Meade&rsquo;s losses were
comparatively light, as his line was well protected by the line of
earthworks. So intense was the artillery and musketry fire that
hundreds of trees were shattered. After the repulse, Johnson&rsquo;s
forces were withdrawn, and this ended their participation in the
battle.</p>
<h3>Meade&rsquo;s Line of the Third Day.</h3>
<p>After the engagement on the morning of the 2nd, the 12th
Corps reoccupied its original line, beginning on the right at
Spangler&rsquo;s Hill and extending to and over Culp&rsquo;s Hill. Wadsworth&rsquo;s
Division of the 1st Corps retained its position of the 2nd,
between Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Barlow&rsquo;s Division under Ames of the
11th Corps, at the foot of East Cemetery Hill. Barlow&rsquo;s Division
was strengthened by a brigade of the 2nd Corps. Doubleday&rsquo;s
Division of the 1st Corps, which had taken the position of Caldwell&rsquo;s
Division on the left of the 2nd Corps, remained. Caldwell
was posted so as to support the artillery reserve to the left of
Doubleday.</p>
<p>The other divisions of the 1st and 2nd Corps remained in the
positions they occupied on the morning of the 2nd. The 5th Corps
extended the line from the left of the artillery reserve to Big
Round Top. Some of the brigades of the 6th Corps were put in
position as local reserves and others to protect the flanks of the
line. The 3rd Corps was posted in rear of the center as a general
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
reserve. A detachment of cavalry was in reserve in rear of the 2nd
Corps at the Angle. Few changes were made in the artillery
positions. Beginning at Cemetery Hill and extending to Little
Round Top, about ninety guns, under General Hunt, were in
position to operate.</p>

</div>
<h3>Lee&rsquo;s Line of the Third Day.</h3>
<p>Beginning on the right, Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps held the ground
west of Plum Run, including the base of Big Round Top, Devil&rsquo;s
Den, and the Peach Orchard. Pickett&rsquo;s Division, after its arrival
on the field on the morning of the 3rd, took the place of Anderson
in reserve. Heth&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s Divisions extended the line to the
left on Seminary Ridge, connecting with part of Rodes&rsquo; Division
in the western part of the town. Early&rsquo;s and Johnson&rsquo;s Divisions,
after the engagement on the morning of the 3rd, held their positions
of the 2nd. Changes in the positions of the batteries of
artillery were made on the morning of the 3rd. A total of 138
guns were in position to operate. Those on the right were in charge
of Colonel E. P. Alexander; those on the left under Colonel R. L.
Walker.</p>
<h3>The Bliss Buildings.</h3>
<p>After the end of the engagement at Culp&rsquo;s Hill at 10.30 <span class="small">A.M.</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
there was a short battle for the capture of the Bliss house and barn,
midway between the lines in front of Ziegler&rsquo;s Grove. These buildings
were occupied by Confederate sharpshooters, who were
causing considerable loss in Hays&rsquo; line of the 2nd Corps at the
grove. Two regiments were sent forward, the 12th New Jersey
and the 14th Connecticut, and the buildings were captured and
burned.</p>
<h3>The Artillery Duel.</h3>
<p>Until 1 o&rsquo;clock there was comparative quiet. It was ended on
the stroke of the hour by two guns of Miller&rsquo;s battery belonging
to the Washington artillery of New Orleans, posted near the Peach
Orchard, and fired in rapid succession as a signal to the Confederate
artillery.</p>
<p>The Confederate Colonel Alexander says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>At exactly 1 o&rsquo;clock by my watch the two signal guns were heard in quick
succession. In another minute every gun was at work. The enemy was not
slow in coming back at us, and the grand roar of nearly the whole of both
armies burst in on the silence.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The enemy&rsquo;s position seemed to have broken out with guns everywhere,
and from Round Top to Cemetery Hill was blazing like a volcano.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The artillery duel was but a preface, intended to clear the
ground for the infantry action to follow. The order had already
been given by Longstreet to Alexander:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Colonel: The intention is to advance the infantry if the artillery has the
desired effect of driving the enemy off, or having other effect such as to warrant
us in making the attack. When the moment arrives advise General Pickett, and
of course advance such artillery as you can use in making the attack.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Wright, who was present when this order was received,
expressed doubt as to whether the attack could be successfully
made. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It is not so hard to go there as it looks; I was nearly there with my brigade
yesterday. The trouble is to stay there. The whole Yankee army is there in a
bunch.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For one and a half hours the air was filled with screaming,
whistling shot and shell. An occasional Whitworth missile, from
Oak Hill on the north, made, on account of its peculiar form, a
noise that could be heard above the din of all others. The headquarters
of General Meade at the Leister House formed a concentric
point continually swept with a storm of shot and shell. Headquarters
were therefore moved to Slocum&rsquo;s headquarters at
Powers&rsquo; Hill, along the Baltimore Pike.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Batteries on the Union line, especially at the Angle, were badly
damaged, and General Hunt had others brought forward with additional
supplies of ammunition. On the whole the losses inflicted
upon the Union infantry were comparatively light. The stone wall
and the undulations of the ground afforded protection, as most of
the men were lying down.</p>
<p>After the artillery had operated for about an hour and a half,
Meade and Hunt deemed it prudent to stop the fire, in order to
cool the guns, save ammunition, and allow the atmosphere between
the lines to clear of the dense cloud of smoke before the expected
attack was made. This pause in the fire led the Confederates to
believe that the Union line was demoralized, and that the opportune
time had arrived for the onset of the infantry. Accordingly,
they moved forward and Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was on.</p>
<p>At the signal station on Little Round Top, General Warren
and others saw gray infantry moving out across the plain in front
of the Spangler Woods. Warren at once wig-wagged to General
Hunt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They are moving out to attack.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This message was passed from man to man along the entire
Union line.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h3>Pickett&rsquo;s Charge.</h3>
<p>Pickett&rsquo;s Division of Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps was moved from the
rear to the ravine in front of the Spangler Woods and placed in line
as follows: Kemper on the right; Garnett on the left in the front
line; Armistead in the rear, overlapping Kemper&rsquo;s left and Garnett&rsquo;s
right, in the second line. On the left of Garnett was ranged
Archer&rsquo;s Brigade of Hill&rsquo;s Corps under Frye, then Pettigrew&rsquo;s
Brigade under Marshall. Next to Marshall came Davis&rsquo; Brigade
of Hill&rsquo;s Corps, and on the extreme left Brockenbrough&rsquo;s Brigade,
also of Hill&rsquo;s Corps. In the rear of the right of Pickett were the
brigades of Wilcox and Perry of Hill&rsquo;s Corps and in the rear of
Pettigrew were the brigades of Scales and Lane of Hill&rsquo;s Corps,
in command of Trimble.</p>
<p>The column of assault consisted of 42 regiments&mdash;19 Virginia,
15 North Carolina, 2 Alabama, 3 Tennessee, and 3 Mississippi&mdash;a
total of about 15,000 men.</p>
<p>In addition to the artillery fire, they encountered 27 regiments&mdash;9
of New York, 5 of Pennsylvania, 3 of Massachusetts, 3 of
Vermont, 1 of Michigan, 1 of Maine, 1 of Minnesota, 1 of New
Jersey, 1 of Connecticut, 1 of Ohio, and 1 of Delaware&mdash;a total of
9,000 to 10,000 men.</p>
<p>In advance of the assaulting column a strong skirmish line was
deployed. A skirmish line was also deployed in front of Meade&rsquo;s
line, which fell back as the assaulting column drew near.</p>
<h3>The Advance.</h3>
<p>General Longstreet ordered General Alexander, Chief of
Artillery, to watch the havoc wrought in the Union line and
signify the moment for advance.</p>
<p>General Alexander says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Before the cannonade opened I made up my mind to give the order to
advance within fifteen or twenty minutes after it began. But when I looked at
the full development of the enemy&rsquo;s batteries and knew that his infantry was
generally protected from fire by stone walls and swells of the ground, I could
not bring myself to give the word.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I let the 15 minutes pass, and 20, and 25, hoping vainly for something
to turn up. Then I wrote to Pickett: &lsquo;If you are coming at all, come at once,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
or I cannot give you proper support; but the enemy&rsquo;s fire has not slackened at
all; at least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Five minutes after sending that message, the enemy&rsquo;s fire suddenly began
to slacken, and the guns in the cemetery limbered up and vacated the position.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Then I wrote to Pickett: &lsquo;Come quick; eighteen guns are gone; unless you
advance quick, my ammunition won&rsquo;t let me support you properly.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pickett then rode forward, and on meeting Longstreet said: &lsquo;General,
shall I advance?&rsquo; Longstreet nodded his assent and the column moved forward.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The column passed through the line of guns, fifteen or eighteen
of which had been ordered to follow. Meanwhile the eighteen
Union guns that were withdrawn were replaced by others. The
Union line was once more intact, and it opened a terrific fire
against the rapidly moving columns of assault. As the Confederates
continued to advance, their courage unaffected in face of the
tremendous fire of both artillery and infantry, their enemies were
filled with admiration.</p>
<p>At the Emmitsburg Road, where post-and-rail fences had to
be crossed, the line was broken, but only for a moment. The
musketry fire from the Union line was so heavy that the attacking
column was unable to maintain a regular alignment, and when the
Angle was reached the identity of the different brigades was lost.</p>
<p>Armistead&rsquo;s Brigade forged to the front at the Angle, and,
reaching the wall, Armistead raised his hat on his sword and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Give them the cold steel, boys!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a few men he advanced to Cushing&rsquo;s guns, where he fell,
mortally wounded. Cushing also was mortally wounded. Garnett,
who was mounted, was killed a short distance from the wall. Kemper
was badly wounded. Pickett lost all of his field officers but one.
The Union Generals Hancock and Gibbon were wounded at the
same time. For a short time the struggle was hand to hand.</p>
<p>To the right of the Angle most of the brigades on Pickett&rsquo;s left
reached the stone wall on Hays&rsquo; front at Ziegler&rsquo;s Grove, but
were obliged to retreat after meeting a withering fire both in front
and on flank.</p>
<p>The brigades of Wilcox and Perry, in the rear of Pickett&rsquo;s right,
did not move until after the advance lines were part way across.
Because of a misunderstanding, a gap was opened between Pickett&rsquo;s
right and Wilcox&rsquo;s left. At once Stannard&rsquo;s Vermont Brigade of
the 1st Corps attacked both Pickett&rsquo;s right and Wilcox&rsquo;s left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>General Pickett, who had reached the Codori buildings, saw
that the assaulting forces were unable to accomplish the object
of the charge, and ordered a retreat. It was accomplished, but
with heavy losses.</p>
<p>Both commanding officers witnessed the retreat: General
Meade from where his statue stands east of the Angle, and General
Lee from the position of his statue north of the Spangler Woods.</p>

</div>
<h3>Engagements on the Union Left.</h3>
<p>While Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was under way, the Pennsylvania
Reserves, under McCandless, charged from the stone wall on the
east side of the Wheatfield and regained possession of Devil&rsquo;s Den
and adjacent territory held by Longstreet&rsquo;s forces since the
engagement of the afternoon of the 2nd. Farther south, between
Big Round Top and the line held by Longstreet&rsquo;s right, a cavalry
charge was made by Farnsworth&rsquo;s Brigade of Kilpatrick&rsquo;s Division.
Farnsworth was killed. Merritt&rsquo;s Brigade of Buford&rsquo;s Division,
which reached the field on the 3rd, engaged some of Longstreet&rsquo;s
troops along the Emmitsburg Road. The accomplished object of
these movements was to prevent Longstreet from giving assistance
to the charge of Pickett on Meade&rsquo;s center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3>The Cavalry Fight on the Right Flank.</h3>
<p>As already noted, General Stuart in his movement in rear of
the Army of the Potomac with three brigades of cavalry&mdash;Fitzhugh
Lee&rsquo;s, Wade Hampton&rsquo;s, and Chambliss&rsquo;&mdash;reached Hanover on
June 30th, fought a battle in the streets, and moved on to Carlisle
on the afternoon of July 1st. There he got in touch with the main
Confederate Army, with which he had been out of communication
for seven days.</p>
<p>After an encounter with a portion of Kilpatrick&rsquo;s forces at
Hunterstown on the afternoon of July 2nd, he moved up to a
position between the Hunterstown and Harrisburg roads on Ewell&rsquo;s
left, expecting to reach Meade&rsquo;s rear about the time of Pickett&rsquo;s
Charge on Meade&rsquo;s front. He was joined by Jenkins&rsquo; Confederate
Brigade of mounted infantry armed with Enfield rifles. Jenkins
was wounded at Hunterstown, and the brigade and the command
fell to Colonel Ferguson.</p>
<p>General Gregg, in command of the 2nd Cavalry Division of the
Union Army, reached the field east of Gettysburg at the intersection
of the Hanover and Low Dutch roads at 11 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on
July 2nd. In the afternoon he halted a movement of Walker&rsquo;s
brigade of Johnson&rsquo;s Division, Ewell&rsquo;s Corps, in their movement
from Brinkerhoff Ridge to assist in the attack on Meade&rsquo;s right at
Culp&rsquo;s Hill. He bivouacked for the night near the bridge across
White Run. On the morning of the 3rd he returned to the position
of the 2nd, and took an active part in the cavalry fight on the right
flank at the time of Pickett&rsquo;s Charge. In the afternoon, in the
important engagement on East Cavalry Field he successfully opposed
General Stuart in his efforts to get behind the Union line.</p>
<h3>The Location.</h3>
<p>East Cavalry Field is 3 miles east of Gettysburg and includes
the territory lying between the York Pike on the north and the
Hanover Road on the south. On the east it is bounded by the
Low Dutch Road which intersects the Baltimore Pike at its southern
end, and the York Pike at its northern end. Brinkerhoff Ridge,
which crosses the Hanover Road at right angles about 1&frac12; miles
east of the town, forms its boundary on the west. Cress Ridge is
formed by the elevation between Cress&rsquo;s Run on the west and Little&rsquo;s
Run on the east. Both ridges right angle across the Hanover Road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>All the positions held by troops have been marked and the
entire field is readily accessible over well-built roads and avenues.
Because of its partial isolation from the principal fields, this
important area is not visited as frequently as it should be.</p>
<h3>General Stuart&rsquo;s Plan.</h3>
<p>General Stuart did not wish to bring on a general engagement.
He expected his skirmishers to keep the Union Cavalry engaged
while his other forces were moving undiscovered toward the rear
of Meade&rsquo;s line. He says in his report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On the morning of July 3, pursuant to instructions from the commanding
general, I moved forward to a position to the left of Gen. Ewell&rsquo;s left, and in
advance of it, where a commanding ridge (Cress Ridge) completely controlled
a wide plain of cultivated fields stretching toward Hanover, on the left, and
reaching to the base of the mountain spurs, among which the enemy held position.
My command was increased by the addition of Jenkins&rsquo; Brigade, who
here in the presence of the enemy allowed themselves to be supplied with but
10 rounds of ammunition, although armed with approved Enfield muskets.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I moved this command and W. H. F. Lee&rsquo;s secretly through the woods to
a position, and hoped to effect a surprise upon the enemy&rsquo;s rear, but Hampton&rsquo;s
and Fitz Lee&rsquo;s Brigades, which had been ordered to follow me, unfortunately
debouched into the open ground, disclosing the movement, and causing a
corresponding movement of a large force of the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the advance of Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee which caused
Stuart&rsquo;s plans to miscarry.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

</div>
<h3>General Gregg&rsquo;s Report.</h3>
<p>On the Union side, General D. McM. Gregg had under his
command three brigades of cavalry&mdash;one in command of General
George A. Custer, who later was responsible for &ldquo;Custer&rsquo;s Last
Charge&rdquo; in Indian warfare. General Gregg&rsquo;s report gives a brief
description of the many charges and countercharges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A strong line of skirmishers displayed by the enemy was evidence that
the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry had gained our right, and were about to attack, with the
view of gaining the rear of our line of battle. The importance of successfully
resisting an attack at this point, which, if succeeded in by the enemy, would
have been productive of the most serious consequences, determined me to retain
the brigade of the Third Division until the enemy were driven back. General
Custer, commanding the brigade, fully satisfied of the intended attack, was
well pleased to remain with his brigade. The First New Jersey Cavalry was
posted as mounted skirmishers to the right and front in a wood. The Third
Pennsylvania Cavalry deployed as dismounted skirmishers to the left and
front in open fields, and the First Maryland on the Hanover turnpike, in
position to protect the right of my line.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The very superior force of dismounted skirmishers of the enemy advanced
on our left and front required the line to be re-enforced by one of General Custer&rsquo;s
regiments. At this time the skirmishing became very brisk on both sides, and
the artillery fire was begun by the enemy and ourselves. During the skirmish
of the dismounted men, the enemy brought upon the field a column for a charge.
The charge of this column was met by the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, of the
First (Second) Brigade, Third Division, but not successfully. The advantage
gained in this charge was soon wrested from the enemy by the gallant charge of
the First Michigan, of the same brigade. This regiment drove the enemy back
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
to his starting point, the enemy withdrew to his left, and on passing the wood
in which the First New Jersey Cavalry was posted, that regiment gallantly and
successfully charged the flank of his column. Heavy skirmishing was still
maintained by the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry with the enemy, and was
continued until nightfall. During the engagement, a portion of this regiment
made a very handsome and successful charge upon one of the enemy&rsquo;s regiments.
The enemy retired his column behind his artillery, and at dark withdrew
from his former position. The fire of the artillery during this engagement
was the most accurate that I have ever seen.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stuart&rsquo;s forces numbered about 7,000, and Gregg and Custer&rsquo;s
about 5,000.</p>
<h3>Lee&rsquo;s Retreat.</h3>
<p>On the night of the 3rd, Lee withdrew all his forces to Seminary
and Snyder ridges. Orders were issued and instructions given for
the retreat to the Potomac River at Williamsport and Falling
Waters. The effectives moved to Fairfield over the Hagerstown or
Fairfield Road. The wagon-train, 17 miles long, with the wounded,
was moved by way of the Cashtown Road (Chambersburg Pike),
under the command of Brigadier-General John D. Imboden,
who has described his interview with General Lee at his headquarters,
which were still located in an orchard in the rear of the
Seminary buildings, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He invited me into his tent, and as soon as we were seated he remarked:
&lsquo;We must now return to Virginia. As many of our poor wounded as possible
must be taken home. I have sent for you because your men and horses are
fresh and in good condition, to guard and conduct our train back to Virginia.
The duty will be arduous, responsible, and dangerous, for I am afraid you
will be harassed by the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry. I can spare you as much artillery
as you may require but no other troops, as I shall need all I have to return
safely by a different and shorter route than yours. The batteries are generally
short of ammunition, but you will probably meet a supply I have ordered from
Winchester to Williamsport.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On account of a terrific rainstorm shortly after noon on the 4th
there was considerable delay in getting the Confederate train
started. Well guarded in front and rear, the head of the column
near Cashtown was put in motion and began the ascent of the
mountain. The wounded suffered indescribable hardships. Many
had been without food for thirty-six hours, and had received no
medical attention since the battle. Among the wounded officers
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
were General Pender and General Scales. The trip cost Pender
his life. General Imboden said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>During this retreat I witnessed the most heartrending scenes of the War.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a military movement the retreat was a success. Though
harassed by pursuing forces, the train reached the Potomac with
comparatively little loss.</p>
<p>The main Confederate Army crossed the mountain, principally
at the Fairfield gap. On account of the heavy rain, Ewell&rsquo;s Corps,
which brought up the rear did not leave Gettysburg until the
forenoon of the 5th. Somewhat delayed, but not seriously impeded,
Lee arrived at the Potomac on July 12, finding it too high
to cross. There he entrenched his army. The next day, the waters
having fallen, he got safely away.</p>
<h3>No Pursuit by Meade.</h3>
<p>Because of Lee&rsquo;s strong position, Meade made no countercharge.
He had won a notable victory, and believed it unwise to risk undoing
his work. His army had suffered heavily. Both armies
moved south. The Confederate cause had received a severe blow.
The defeat at Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg on July
4th to Grant ended all hope of foreign recognition. Yet, for almost
two years the desperate struggle was to continue!</p>

<h3>The Gettysburg Carnage.</h3>
<p>The War records estimate the Union casualties, killed, wounded,
and missing, at 23,000 of the 84,000 engaged. The Confederate
casualties are estimated at over 20,000 of the 75,000 engaged. Approximately
10,000 bodies were left at Gettysburg for burial, and
21,000 living men to be healed of their wounds.</p>
<p>No words can picture the desolation of the little town. As the
soldiers marched away, their places were taken by physicians and
surgeons, nurses and orderlies, civilian as well as military, and the
ministrations of mercy began. In these the citizens of Gettysburg,
especially the women, took an important part. Hither came also
a new army of parents and wives and brothers and sisters, seeking,
sometimes with success, sometimes with grievous disappointment,
for their beloved.</p>
<h2 id="c9">HAPPENINGS ON THE THIRD DAY</h2>
<h4>A Medal for Disobedience</h4>
<p>On the afternoon of July 3rd, Captain William E. Miller, of Company H,
2nd Brigade, of Gregg&rsquo;s Division of Union Cavalry, made a charge against the
Confederate Cavalry, in command of Major-General J. E. B. Stuart, in their movement
from Cress Ridge, East Cavalry Field, to reach the rear of Meade&rsquo;s line at the
time of Pickett&rsquo;s Charge.</p>
<p>The incident is described by Captain William Brooke Rawle, a participant in
the charge, in his &ldquo;History of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the cavalry fighting began, Captain Miller&rsquo;s squadron was stationed in
Lott&rsquo;s woods to the west of the Low Dutch Road, beyond the Hanover Road, and
was deployed, mounted as skirmishers, along the western edge of the woods. There
was considerable long-range firing before the climax of the fighting came. About
3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon ... a large body of cavalry, which proved to be
Hampton&rsquo;s and Fitzhugh Lee&rsquo;s brigades, was seen approaching in magnificent order,
mounted, from the northern side of the field. Captain Miller and I rode out a few
yards in front of our position to a slight rise in the ground to get a good view. The
enemy quickened his pace, first to a trot, then to a gallop, and then the charge was
sounded. The nearest available compact body of Union Cavalry at hand to meet
the enemy was the 1st Michigan Cavalry of General Custer&rsquo;s brigade, which
was serving temporarily under General Gregg. It was ordered to meet the enemy&rsquo;s
charge by a counter-charge, although the Confederate brigade greatly outnumbered
the Michigan regiment. Captain Miller and I saw at once that unless more men
were sent against the enemy the Michigan regiment would be swept from the field.
He said to me, &lsquo;I have been ordered to hold this position at all hazards, but if you
will back me up if I get into trouble for exceeding my orders, I will make a charge
with the squadron.&rsquo; This was in order to make a diversion in favor of our troops,
and help the Michigan men. I assured him in an emphatic manner that I would
stand by him through thick and thin. He then ordered me to rally the left wing
of the squadron while he did the same with the right. When this was done the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
squadron fired a volley into the Confederate column, which was within easy range.
The men were very impatient to begin their charge, and the right wing, headed
by Captain Miller, started off at a gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone and rail fence divided the line of the squadron front, running at right
angles to it, and I had to make a slight detour to get around it with the left wing
of the squadron. This, and the fact that the head of the squadron was headed to
the right oblique, caused a gap of some thirty yards or so between the rear of the
portion of the squadron under Captain Miller and myself with the left of the left
portion. Meanwhile the two opposing columns had met, and the head of the
Confederate column was fast becoming jammed, and the men on the flanks were
beginning to turn back. Captain Miller, with his men struck the left flank of the
enemy&rsquo;s column pretty well towards the rear, about two-thirds or three-fourths of
the way down, and as the impetus of the latter had stopped while his men had full
headway on, he drove well into the column and cut off its rear and forced it back
in the direction whence it came, and the captain and some of his men got as far
as the Rummel house. As to this last, I learned from the men engaged. Captain
Miller was wounded in the arm during the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I myself with the rear portion of Captain Miller&rsquo;s squadron did not succeed
in getting all the way through. Just as I and my men reached the flank of the
enemy many of the latter were getting to the rear and we were swept along with
the current and scattered, some of us, including myself, though narrowly escaping
capture, succeeding in working our way in one&rsquo;s and two&rsquo;s to the right, where we
got back into our lines again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gallant conduct and dashing charge made by Captain Miller and his men
were commented upon by all who saw it. A fact that made it all the more commendable
was that it was done upon his own responsibility, without orders from a
superior officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In July, 1897, a Congressional Medal of Honor was bestowed upon Captain
Miller by direction of President McKinley, through the Secretary of War, General
Russell A. Alger. The conferring of this tribute was especially appropriate, inasmuch
as General Alger himself had participated on the right flank as the Colonel
of the 5th Michigan, and was therefore eminently competent to decide.</p>
<h4>The Wentz House</h4>
<p>The Wentz house, which stands at the intersection of the Emmitsburg and
Wheatfield roads, is now a Government-owned property, and is marked with an
iron tablet with the inscription &ldquo;Wentz House.&rdquo; It is not the house that was there
at the time of the battle; the original building was dismantled and the present
building erected on the same site.</p>
<p>At the time of the battle the house was owned and occupied by John Wentz,
who cultivated the small tract of land belonging to it. He was twice married, and
at this time was living with his second wife, who was the mother of Henry Wentz,
the principal actor in an interesting incident of the battle of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>For many years before the beginning of the Civil War, carriage and coach-building
was one of the leading industries of Gettysburg. Henry Wentz served an
apprenticeship with the Ziegler firm of Gettysburg. He was frequently sent to
deliver the products of the firm, and thereby became well acquainted with the
different sections where sales were made.</p>
<p>In the early &rsquo;50&rsquo;s he decided to move to Martinsburg, Va. (now W. Va.), and
establish a carriage-building shop of his own. When a local military organization
was formed and designated the &ldquo;Martinsburg Blues,&rdquo; Henry became a member.
Equipped with uniforms and arms, the members were drilled from time to time.
Similar organizations were formed throughout the North as well as the South.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Most of the members of the Martinsburg Blues, including Henry Wentz, decided
to cast their lot with the Southern cause, and were assigned to places in the armies
of the South. But, by the irony of fate, he was destined to get back to his old home
and command a battery posted back of the house on his father&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>During the first day the Wentz property was not in danger, but when General
Lee extended his line of battle south along the line of Seminary Ridge, and General
Meade prolonged his line opposite on Cemetery Ridge in preparation for the battle
of the second day, the Wentz family, with the exception of the father, decided to
seek a safer location. On the night of the second day, after Sickles&rsquo; advanced line
at the Wentz house had been repulsed and occupied by the forces under General
Lee, Henry Wentz visited his old home and was greatly surprised to find his father
still there.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the third day, 75 guns, in command of Colonel E. P.
Alexander, were moved forward from Lee&rsquo;s first line to the line held by Sickles&rsquo;
advanced line on the second day. The battery in charge of Henry Wentz, who held
the rank of lieutenant, was posted back of his old home, and he took an active
part in the terrific artillery engagement prior to Pickett&rsquo;s Charge that ended on
that part of the field. Henry&rsquo;s father kept to the cellar and, singularly, passed
through it all unharmed and unhurt.</p>
<p>After the repulse of Pickett&rsquo;s Charge, the guns were withdrawn to their first
line. During the night of the third day, Henry was anxious to know whether or not
his father was still safe. He therefore went over to the house and found him fast
asleep and unhurt in a corner of the cellar. Not wishing to disturb his much-needed
rest, he found the stump of a candle, lit it, and wrote, &ldquo;Good-bye and God bless
you!&rdquo; This message he pinned on the lapel of his father&rsquo;s coat and returned to his
command preparatory to the retreat to Virginia.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 4th, the father awoke from his much-needed sleep
and found that all the soldiers had departed. He then walked back to the ridge
and saw Lee&rsquo;s army making hurried preparations for the retreat.</p>
<h4>Fought with a Hatchet</h4>
<p>At the battle of Gettysburg the 13th Vermont was a part of General Stannard&rsquo;s
Vermont command. The 2nd Vermont brigade had been left on outpost duty in
Virginia until the third day after the Army of the Potomac had passed in pursuit of
Lee&rsquo;s troops into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Then the brigade got orders to
proceed by forced marches to join the Army of the Potomac. The latter was also
on a forced march, but in six days&rsquo; time the Vermonters had overtaken the main
body. Just before the first day&rsquo;s battle, Captain Brown&rsquo;s command came up to a
well, at which was an armed guard. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get water here,&rdquo; said the guard.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Gainst orders.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damn your orders!&rdquo; said Captain Brown, and then with all the
canteens of the men, and with only one man to help him, he thrust the guard aside
and filled the canteens. His arrest followed, and he was deprived of his sword.</p>
<p>When the battle began, Captain Brown was a prisoner. He begged for a chance
to rejoin his company, and was allowed to go. His men were far away at the front,
and he had no weapons. He picked up a camp hatchet and ran all the way to the
firing-line, reached it, rushed into the fray, and singling out a Rebel officer 50 yards
away, penetrated the Rebel ranks, collared the officer, wresting from him his sword
and pistol, after which he dropped the hatchet, while his men cheered him amid the
storm of bullets and smoke.</p>
<p>When the design for the 13th Vermont monument was made, it was the desire
of the committee to have the statue represent Captain Brown, hatchet in hand.
Accordingly, a model was prepared, but the Federal Government would not permit
its erection. A second model was approved, showing Captain Brown holding a
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
sabre and belt in his hand, the hatchet lying at his feet as though just dropped.
The sabre depicted in the statue is an exact reproduction of the one captured.</p>
<p>This monument is on the east side of Hancock Avenue, near the large Stannard
monument.</p>
<h4>After the Battle</h4>
<p>This is an extract from &ldquo;Four Years with the Army of the Potomac,&rdquo; by
Brigadier-General Regis de Trobriand, who commanded a brigade of Birney&rsquo;s
Division of the 3rd Corps during the battle of Gettysburg:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the 3rd, as the last glimmers
of daylight disappeared behind us, I received an order to go down into the flat,
and occupy the field of battle with two brigades in line. That of Colonel Madill
was added to mine for that purpose. General Ward, who temporarily commanded
the Division, remained in reserve with the 3rd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most profound calm reigned now, where a few hours before so furious a
tempest had raged. The moon, with her smiling face, mounted up in the starry
heavens as at Chancellorsville. Her pale light shone equally upon the living and
the dead, the little flowers blooming in the grass as well as upon the torn bodies
lying in the pools of clotted blood. Dead bodies were everywhere. On no field of
battle have I ever seen them in such numbers. The greater part of my line was
strewn with them, and, when the arms were stacked and the men asleep, one was
unable to say, in that mingling of living and dead, which would awake the next
morning and which would not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the line of advanced sentinels, the wounded still lay where they had
fallen, calling for assistance or asking for water. Their cries died away without any
reply in the silence of the night, for the enemy was close by, and it was a dangerous
undertaking to risk advancing into the space which separated us. In making an
attempt, an officer of my staff drew three shots, which whistled unpleasantly near
his ears. All labors of charity were necessarily put off till the next morning. It is
sad to think that this was a sentence of death to numbers of the unfortunate.
Mournful thoughts did not hinder the tired soldiers from sleeping. Everything
was soon forgotten in a dreamless slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At dawn of day, when I awakened, the first object which struck my eyes was
a young sergeant stretched out on his back, his head resting on a flat stone, serving
for a pillow. His position was natural, even graceful. One knee slightly raised, his
hands crossed on his breast, a smile on his lips, caused by a dream, perhaps, of her who
awaited his return in the distant Green Mountains. He was dead. Wounded, he
had sought out this spot in which to die. His haversack was near him. He had
taken out of it a little book on which his last looks had been cast, for the book
was still open in his stiffened fingers. It was the New Testament; on the first leaf
a light hand had traced in pencil, some letters, rubbed out, which one might think
were a name. I have kept the volume, and on the white space, to the unknown
name I have added, &lsquo;Died at Gettysburg, July 3, 1863.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the night, the enemy had drawn back his pickets to the other side of
the Emmitsburg Road, and left us free access to assist the wounded. The appearance
of litters and ambulance wagons strengthened them, by giving them hope.
They related their engagements of the evening before, and their sufferings during
the night. One of them, pointing out the dead lying around him, said: &lsquo;This one
lived only till sundown; that one lasted until about midnight. There is one who
was still groaning but an hour ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuing my walk, I came near a large isolated rock. It might have been
eight or ten feet high, and fifteen or twenty feet broad. Rounding on the side
towards the enemy, but flat as a wall on the opposite side, it had served as an
advanced post for one of our companies, probably belonging to Stannard&rsquo;s brigade.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
What had happened there? Had they been surprised by the rapid advance of the
enemy? Had they tried to shelter themselves behind that stone during the fight?
Had the firing of canister by our guns rendered retreat impossible? Had they
refused to surrender? No one, to my knowledge, escaped to tell. Whatever was the
cause, there were twenty lying there cut down by lead and steel, and amongst
the pile I recognized the uniform of an officer and the chevrons of a sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I returned to the center of my line, the ambulances were at work, and
squads detailed from each regiment picked up the arms which were scattered by
thousands over the field. A little later my command was relieved, and again took
its position of the evening before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some reconnaissances sent out to look for the enemy had not far to go to
find him. His pickets were still on the edge of the woods in front of the Seminary
Heights. We afterwards learned that he expected, during the whole day, that we
would attack, hoping to get revenge. But General Meade, content with his victory,
would not take the risk of compromising it by leaving his position before Lee had
abandoned his, in which he acted wisely, whatever may have been said to the
contrary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The afternoon was thus spent in first picking up our wounded and afterwards
those of the enemy. The ambulance wagons were hardly enough for the work.
The litter-bearers placed the wounded along our lines, where they had to await
their turn to be taken to the rear. We did what we could to make the delay as
short as possible, for many of them were brave Southern boys, some having enlisted
because they honestly believed it was their duty, others torn by force from their
families, to be embodied in the Rebel army by the inexorable conscription. After
the defeat, they were resigned, without boasting, and expressed but one wish: that
the war would terminate as soon as possible, since the triumph of the North appeared
to be but a question of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall to mind a young man from Florida who told me his history. His name
was Perkins, and he was scarcely twenty years old. The only son of aged parents,
he had in vain endeavored to escape service. Tracked everywhere by the agents of
the Richmond government, he had been forced to take up the musket, and had
done his duty so well that he had been rapidly promoted to sergeant. In the last
charge of the day before, he had had his left heel carried away by a piece of shell,
and his right hand shattered by a canister shot. One amputation, at least, probably
two, was what he had to expect; and yet he did not complain. But when he spoke
of his aged parents awaiting his return, and of the sad condition in which he would
re-enter the paternal home, his smile was more heart-breaking than any complaint.
In order that his wounds might be sooner dressed, one of my aids, Lieutenant
Houghton, let him have his horse, at the risk of marching on foot if we moved
before he was returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next night we passed in the rain. It always rains on the day after a great
battle. On the morning following we discovered the enemy to be in full retreat.
Seeing that the attack he expected did not come off, and fearing for the safety of
his communications with the Potomac, General Lee could do nothing else but
retire through the mountains, which he did during the night of the 4th and 5th of
July. Then only began that disorder in his columns, and that confusion, the picture
of which has been somewhat exaggerated; an almost inevitable consequence, besides,
to that kind of a movement. Our cavalry began to harass him on the flanks, while
the 6th Corps, having remained intact, pressed on his rear-guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulties that General Sedgwick met in the Fairfield pass, where the
enemy had intrenched, probably made General Meade fear that a direct pursuit
would entail too great loss of time in the mountains. So, instead of following Lee
in the valley of the Cumberland, he decided to march on a parallel line, to the east
of the South Mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h4>An Honest Man</h4>
<p>General E. P. Alexander, Chief of Artillery of Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps, tells of a
trade that occurred during the retreat from Gettysburg:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near Hagerstown I had an experience with an old Dunkard which gave me a
high and lasting respect for the people of that faith. My scouts had had a horse
transaction with this old gentleman, and he came to see me about it. He made
no complaint, but said it was his only horse, and as the scouts had told him we
had some hoof-sore horses we should have to leave behind, he came to ask if I
would trade him one of those for his horse, as without one his crop would be lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognized the old man at once as a born gentleman in his delicate characterization
of the transaction as a trade. I was anxious to make the trade as square as
circumstances would permit. So I assented to his taking a foot-sore horse, and
offered him besides payment in Confederate money. This he respectfully declined.
Considering how the recent battle had gone, I waived argument on the point of its
value but tried another suggestion. I told him that we were in Maryland as the
guests of the United States; that after our departure the Government would pay
all bills left behind; and that I would give him an order on the United States for
the value of his horse and have it approved by General Longstreet. To my surprise
he declined this also. I supposed then that he was simply ignorant of the bonanza
in a claim against the Government, and I explained that; and, telling him that
money was no object to us under the circumstances, I offered to include the value
of his whole farm. He again said he wanted nothing but the foot-sore horse. Still
anxious that the war should not grind this poor old fellow in his poverty, I suggested
that he take two or three foot-sore horses which we would have to leave anyhow,
when we marched. Then he said, &lsquo;Well, sir, I am a Dunkard, and the rule of our
church is an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, and a horse for a horse, and I
can&rsquo;t break the rule.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied that the Lord, who made all horses, knew that a good horse was worth a
dozen old battery scrubs; and after some time prevailed on him to take two, by
calling one of them a gift. But that night we were awakened about midnight by
approaching hoofs, and turned out expecting to receive some order. It was my old
Dunkard leading one of his foot-sores. &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you made it look all
right to me today when you were talking; but after I went to bed tonight I got to
thinking it all over, and I don&rsquo;t think I can explain it to the church, and I would
rather not try.&rsquo; With that he tied old foot-sore to a fence and rode off abruptly.
Even at this late day it is a relief to my conscience to tender to his sect this recognition
of their integrity and honesty, in lieu of the extra horse which I vainly endeavored
to throw into the trade. Their virtues should commend them to all
financial institutions in search of incorruptible employees.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Extracts from the Diary of Colonel Fremantle</h4>
<p>Colonel Fremantle, a member of the Cold Stream Guards, was a guest of the
Army of Northern Virginia during the Gettysburg campaign. After the battle of
Gettysburg, he returned to England and published &ldquo;Three Months in the Southern
States.&rdquo; The following is a vivid extract, describing a part of the battle from the
Confederate lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>July 1st (Wednesday).</i> At 4.30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> we came in sight of Gettysburg, and
joined General Lee and General Hill, who were on the top of one of the ridges
which form a peculiar feature of the country round Gettysburg. We could see the
enemy retreating up one of the opposite ridges, pursued by the Confederates with
loud yells. The position into which the enemy had been driven was evidently a
strong one. His right appeared to rest on a cemetery, on the top of a high ridge to
the right of Gettysburg, as we looked at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;General Hill now came up and told me he had been very unwell all day, and
in fact he looks very delicate. He said he had two divisions engaged, and had driven
the enemy four miles into the present position, capturing a great many prisoners,
some cannon, and some colors. He said, however, that the Yankees had fought
with a determination unusual to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>July 2nd (Thursday).</i> At 2 <span class="small">P.M.</span> General Longstreet advised me, if I wished to
have a good view of the battle, to return to my tree of yesterday. I did so and
remained there with Lawley and Captain Schreibert during the rest of the afternoon.
But until 4.45 <span class="small">P.M.</span> all was profoundly quiet, and we began to doubt whether
a fight was coming off today at all. At that time, however, Longstreet suddenly
commenced a heavy cannonade on the right. Ewell immediately took it up on the
left. The enemy replied with equal fury, and in a few moments the firing along the
whole line was as heavy as it is possible to conceive. A dense smoke arose for six
miles; there was little wind to drive it away, and the air seemed full of shells&mdash;each
of which appeared to have a different style of going, and made a different noise
from the others. The ordnance on both sides is of a very varied description. Every
now and then a caisson would blow up&mdash;if a Federal one, a Confederate yell would
immediately follow. The Southern troops, when charging, or to express their
delight, always yell in a manner peculiar to themselves. The Yankee cheer is
much like ours, but the Confederate officers declare that the Rebel yell has a
particular merit, and always produces a salutary effect upon their adversaries. A
corps is sometimes spoken of as &lsquo;a good yelling regiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the firing began, General Lee joined Hill just below our tree, and
he remained there nearly all the time, looking through his field-glasses, sometimes
talking to Hill and sometimes to Colonel Long of his staff. But generally he sat
quite alone on the stump of a tree. What I remarked especially was, that during
the whole time the firing continued, he sent only one message, and received only
one report. It evidently is his system to arrange the plan thoroughly with the
three commanders, and then leave to them the duty of modifying and carrying it
out to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the cannonade was at its height, a Confederate band of music, between
the cemetery and ourselves, began to play polkas and waltzes, which sounded very
curious, accompanied by the hissing and bursting of the shells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 5.45 all became comparatively quiet on our left and in the cemetery; but
volleys of musketry on the right told us that Longstreet&rsquo;s infantry were advancing,
and the onward progress of the smoke showed that he was progressing favorably;
but about 6.30 there seemed to be a check, and even a slight retrograde movement....
A little before dark the firing dropped off in every direction, and soon ceased
altogether. We then received intelligence that Longstreet had carried everything
before him for some time, capturing several batteries and driving the enemy from
his positions; but when Hill&rsquo;s Florida brigade and some other troops gave way, he
was forced to abandon a small portion of the ground he had won, together with all
the captured guns, except three. His troops, however, bivouacked during the night
on ground occupied by the enemy in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>July 3rd (Friday).</i> At 2.30 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, after passing General Lee and his staff, I
rode on through the woods in the direction in which I had left Longstreet. I soon
began to meet many wounded men returning from the front; many of them asked
in piteous tones the way to a doctor or an ambulance. The further I got, the greater
became the number of the wounded. At last I came to a perfect stream of them
flocking through the woods in numbers as great as the crowd in Oxford Street in
the middle of the day. Some were walking alone on crutches composed of two rifles,
others were supported by men less badly wounded than themselves, and others
carried on stretchers by the ambulance corps, but in no case did I see a sound man
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
helping the wounded to the rear unless he carried the red badge of the ambulance
corps. They were still under heavy fire, the shells bringing down great limbs of
trees, and carrying further destruction amongst this melancholy procession. I
saw all this in much less time than it takes to write it, and although astonished to
meet such vast numbers of wounded, I had not seen enough to give me any idea
of the real extent of the mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I got close up to General Longstreet, I saw one of his regiments advancing
through the woods in good order; so, thinking I was just in time to see the
attack, I remarked to the General that &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this for anything.&rsquo;
Longstreet was seated at the top of a snake fence at the edge of the woods (Spangler
Woods), and looking perfectly calm and unperturbed. He replied, laughing, &lsquo;The
devil you wouldn&rsquo;t! I would like to have missed it very much; we&rsquo;ve attacked and
been repulsed: look there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time I then had a view of the open space between the two positions,
and saw it covered with Confederates slowly and sulkily returning towards
us in small broken parties, under a heavy fire of artillery. But the fire where we
were was not so bad as further to the rear; for although the air seemed alive with
shells, yet the greater number burst behind us. The General told me that Pickett&rsquo;s
Division had succeeded in carrying the enemy&rsquo;s position and captured his guns, but
after remaining there twenty minutes, it had been forced to retire on the retreat of
Heth and Pettigrew on his left....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Walton was the only officer with him (Longstreet) when I came up&mdash;all
the rest had been put in the charge. In a few minutes Major Latrobe arrived on
foot, carrying his saddle, having just had his horse killed. Colonel Sorrell was also
in the same predicament, and Captain Goree&rsquo;s horse was wounded in the mouth....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after I joined General Lee, who had in the meanwhile come to that part
of the field on becoming aware of the disaster. If Longstreet&rsquo;s conduct was admirable,
that of General Lee was perfectly sublime. He was engaged in rallying
and in encouraging the broken troops, and was riding about a little in front of the
woods, quite alone&mdash;the whole of his staff being engaged in a similar manner further
to the rear. His face, which is always placid and cheerful, did not show signs of the
slightest disappointment, or annoyance; and he was addressing to every soldier
he met a few words of encouragement, such as, &lsquo;All this will come right in the end:
we&rsquo;ll talk it over afterwards; but, in the meantime, all good men must rally. We
want all good and true men just now.&rsquo; He spoke to all the wounded men that
passed him, and the slightly wounded he exhorted &lsquo;to bind up their hurts and take
up a musket&rsquo; in this emergency. Very few failed to answer his appeal, and I saw
many badly wounded men take off their hats and cheer him. He said to me, &lsquo;This
has been a sad day for us, Colonel&mdash;a sad day; but we can&rsquo;t expect always to gain
victories.&rsquo; He was also kind enough to advise me to get into some more sheltered
position as the shells were bursting round us with considerable frequency....</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw General Wilcox come up to him, and explain, almost crying, the state
of his brigade. General Lee immediately shook hands with him and said cheerfully,
&lsquo;Never mind, General, all this has been <i>my</i> fault&mdash;it is I that have lost this fight,
and you must help me out of it in the best way you can.&rsquo; In this manner I saw
General Lee encourage and reanimate his somewhat dispirited troops, and magnanimously
take upon his own shoulders the whole weight of the repulse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c10">GETTYSBURG AND ITS MILITARY PARK</h2>
<p>The Gettysburg National Military Park lies entirely within
the limits of Adams County, Pennsylvania. Gettysburg, the
county-seat, is situated about 8 miles from the Mason and
Dixon&rsquo;s line, the southern boundary of the State. It was founded
in 1780, and named for its founder, James Gettys.</p>
<p>At the time of the battle the town had a population of about
2,000. Little did the quiet inhabitants expect that its peaceful
environs&mdash;Oak Hill, Seminary Ridge, Culp&rsquo;s Hill, Cemetery Hill,
the Round Tops, and Devil&rsquo;s Den&mdash;would witness the most sanguinary
struggle of the Civil War, and that Gettysburg would
gain a lasting fame, unequaled by the most noted battlefields
of the Old World. Not even the commanders, Meade and Lee,
knew where they would meet in battle array. Like two giant
stormclouds, the two armies neared each other for days, neither
foreseeing where they would mingle their lightnings in the storm
of battle. Advance forces met and clashed while making reconnaissances&mdash;and
Gettysburg and its vicinity was selected by accident
rather than by design.</p>
<p>What fame Gettysburg enjoyed was due chiefly to its College,
then called Pennsylvania, now Gettysburg, and to its Lutheran
Theological Seminary. The town had been the home for some years
of Thaddeus Stevens, the &ldquo;Great Commoner,&rdquo; life-long champion
of human rights, savior of the free school system of Pennsylvania,
and after his removal to Lancaster, in 1842, a brilliant leader in the
House of Representatives during the war. The vicinity furnished
its full quota of soldiers, though none of its companies except one,
Company K, First Pennsylvania Reserves, participated in the
battle, the rest being on duty elsewhere.</p>
<p>The population of Gettysburg has increased to 5,500. The
College and Seminary are still flourishing. The College has an enrollment
of over 600 students. A Reserve Officers Training Corps
has been added to the course, and students are being instructed in
military tactics by United States Army officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The area of Gettysburg National Military Park, including East
Cavalry Field 15 miles east of the town, and South Cavalry Field
3 miles south, is nearly 40 square miles. The part surrounding
Gettysburg covers about 24 square miles, and was the scene of the
principal engagements on July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, 1863. The
Government owns a total of 2,441 acres; the remainder is held by
private owners.</p>
<p>The first organization in charge of the battlefield was the
Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association, upon which the
Legislature of Pennsylvania, on April 30th, 1864, conferred the
rights of a corporation. In 1867-68 the Legislature appropriated
$6,000 to be applied to the purchase of portions of the battlegrounds
and the general purposes for which the Association was
incorporated. The money was used to secure the portion of Culp&rsquo;s
Hill upon which the breastworks were still standing; the section of
East Cemetery Hill where Stewart&rsquo;s, Reynolds&rsquo;, Ricketts&rsquo;,
Cooper&rsquo;s and Weidrick&rsquo;s batteries were posted, where the lunettes
still remain; and also a small piece of ground on the slope and summit
of Little Round Top. This purchase was the nucleus of what
became, by additional purchases of the Association and later of the
Gettysburg National Park Commission, the present Gettysburg
National Military Park.</p>

<p>The Legislatures of the Northern States represented in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
battle contributed various sums for the prosecution of the work,
and from time to time new members of the Association were
appointed. As the appropriations were received, additional land
was acquired and avenues were laid out. The erection of monuments
to the different regiments was begun by the State of Massachusetts
in 1879. In 1894, the whole property, about 600 acres of
land, with 17 miles of avenues, giving access to 320 monuments,
was transferred to the United States Government. The Gettysburg
National Military Park was established by Act of Congress, approved
February 11th, 1895, and the Secretary of War appointed
the Gettysburg National Park Commission: Colonel John P.
Nicholson, Pennsylvania, Chairman, John B. Bachelder, Massachusetts,
and Brigadier General William H. Forney, Alabama.
Colonel E. B. Cope was selected as topographical engineer.</p>
<p>Upon the death of General Forney, Major William M. Robbins,
of North Carolina, was appointed to fill the vacancy. John B.
Bachelder was succeeded by Major Charles A. Richardson, of
New York. On the death of Major Robbins, General L. L. Lomax,
of Virginia, was appointed. General Lomax died May 28th, 1913,
and Major Richardson on January 24th, 1917. Colonel Nicholson,
the last surviving member of the Commission, died on March 8th,
1922. All Commissioners, with the exception of John B. Bachelder,
served in the Battle of Gettysburg, and he reached the field immediately
after the battle, continuing his interest and his historical
researches until his death. On the death of Colonel Nicholson,
Colonel E. B. Cope was appointed Superintendent.</p>
<p>The Park is a monument to the devotion of this Commission,
in active operation for thirty years. Colonel Cope was succeeded
(1931) by Colonel E. E. Davis, a native of Iowa, commissioned
Major Quartermaster Reserve Corps, March 6th,
1917, who served overseas in the World War. Colonel Davis
retired on July 16th, 1932. James R. McConaghie, native of Iowa,
a graduate of Harvard College, 1st Lieutenant, 4th Infantry,
3rd Division in the World War, was appointed Superintendent
February 8th, 1933.</p>
<p>The development begun by the Association included laying out
of avenues and erecting of regimental monuments, but nothing
was done toward converting the avenues into permanent roads.
The different lines of battle were not accurately marked, and important
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
sections of land remained in private hands. By the end
of the year the new Commission had made preliminary survey of
20 miles of avenues and proposed avenues, and, the following year,
began construction. Gradually the whole field was made accessible
by almost 35 miles of telford and macadam avenues. These avenues
show the important positions occupied by the contending forces.
Stone bridges were built across the streams. Miles of pipe-fencing
and post-and-rail fencing were constructed, the former along the
avenues indicating the battle-lines and the latter to enclose the
Government land. Five steel observation towers were erected on
prominent points, affording views in all directions.</p>

</div>
<p>An important task of the Commission was the accurate marking
of the lines of battle of the opposing forces. Prominent commanders
of both armies visited the field and assisted in locating the positions
of the corps, divisions, and brigades. Suitable monuments and
markers were then erected, with bronze tablets inscribed with an
account of the operations of each corps, division, and brigade.</p>
<p>Markers also show the locations of the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief,
as well as of the corps commanders of both armies.
Six equestrian statues have been erected by States; also, imposing
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
State monuments by New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North
Carolina and Alabama. There are many smaller markers, placed by
States and other organizations. Bronze statues of division and
brigade commanders have been erected. There are a number of
National Monuments; one in the National Cemetery, where
Lincoln stood when making his immortal address at the dedication
of the cemetery, November 19th, 1863; also one in the south end
of the cemetery bearing a bust of Lincoln, and another on Hancock
Avenue in memory of the troops of the Regular Army. All the
positions held by the Regulars have been marked. The total number
of monuments to date is 845. Four hundred and fifteen guns
indicate the positions of the artillery brigades and battalions.</p>
<p>The relief maps of the Gettysburg National Military Park, on
exhibition at the office in the Federal Building, in Gettysburg, were
designed by the Engineer of the Commission, Colonel E. B. Cope,
and built under his supervision. The largest reproduces 24 square
miles and correctly delineates all the topographical features of the
Park. Many of the monuments and markers erected by the Commission
were also designed by Colonel Cope. The imposing stone
gateway at the entrance to Hancock Avenue was proposed by
the Chairman, Colonel Nicholson, and designed by the Engineer.
This gateway is built of native granite taken from the battlefield.</p>
<p>Celebrations, reunions, dedications, and campfires almost
without number have been held at Gettysburg, bringing to the
field those who participated in the battle, their families and
friends, and many other visitors. For many years, until a permanent
camp was established at Mt. Gretna, the National Guard
of Pennsylvania encamped on the field. The two greatest occasions
were the Twenty-fifth Anniversary in 1888, and the Fiftieth
Anniversary in 1913. The latter was attended by almost 55,000
survivors of the two armies. Ample accommodations were provided
for their comfort and enjoyment. The time extended over a period
of eight days, June 29th to July 6th, and every State in the Union
was represented. The men who had met as mortal enemies fifty
years before now met as brothers. The American soldier is not
only a good fighter but also a good friend. Many donned their
uniforms of &rsquo;63, some of Blue and some of Gray, but in the wearers
great changes had been wrought. The sturdy veterans who in the
vigor of their youth met fifty years before in battle, returned
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
grizzled with age and the ravages of war, many bearing scars.
With keen interest, in pairs and groups, they moved from place to
place relating to each other their experiences. In startling contrast
to the 45,000 casualties of &rsquo;63 there were only seven deaths,
and these from the infirmities
of age and natural causes. The
President of the United States
and many able speakers from
all sections of the country made
addresses to large audiences.
It was an event never to be
forgotten and did much finally
to heal the animosities engendered
by the war.</p>
<p>On July 3, 1922, Marines
from Quantico, Va., under the
command of Brigadier-General
Smedley D. Butler, repeated
Pickett&rsquo;s Charge as it was made
in 1863, and on July 4th conducted
it as such a charge
would be made under present
warfare conditions with modern
equipment and maneuvers.
President Harding, General Pershing, and many others prominent
in the State and Nation enjoyed the display.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Culp&rsquo;s Hill.</span>&mdash;Here the Union troops
held their line late in the afternoon of

</div>
<p>For many years the West Point Military Academy seniors
visited the field, usually in the month of May, remaining several
days in order to study the strategical and tactical features of the
battle in preparation for a required thesis. These visits have been
discontinued since the World War.</p>
<p>In May, 1917, a training-camp for World War soldiers was
established within the limits of the Park. The 4th, 7th and 58th
Regiments of U. S. Infantry were transferred from El Paso, Texas,
augmented by recruits, and divided into six United States Regular
Regiments, viz.: 4th, 7th, 58th, 59th, 60th, and 61st. After being
trained they were sent either to other camps or to the battlefields
of France. During the year 1918 a unit of Tank Service was
trained on the battlefield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The fortifications remaining within the park include a line of
earthworks on Culp&rsquo;s Hill, which was thrown up by the Union
troops of the 12th Corps. On East Cemetery Hill there are a
number of lunettes at the position held by the Union batteries.
The stone wall along the west
side of Hancock Avenue, extending
from the Taneytown
Road to some distance south
of the Angle, where Armistead
crossed it in Pickett&rsquo;s Charge,
is well preserved, and practically
the same as at the time
of the battle. There are some
stone walls on the south side
of Little Round Top that were
erected and used by the Union
forces. At the base of Big
Round Top and along Seminary
Ridge are long stone walls,
erected and used by the Confederates.
The boulders in the
vicinity of Devil&rsquo;s Den and
the Round Tops afforded natural
defences for both armies.
A line of earthworks on South Hancock Avenue is still in good
condition.</p>

<p>The physical features of the Park are both varied and interesting.
Standing in bold relief in the background at a distance of
about 8 miles is a continuation of the Blue Ridge, designated
locally as the South Mountain. This range, bounding the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia and the Cumberland Valley of Pennsylvania,
screened the advance of the Confederate Army, and it
was at the Cashtown Gap that General Lee ordered a concentration
of his forces before his advance on Gettysburg.</p>
<p>The entire surface of the Park consists of low ridges and intervening
valleys, beginning on the north in Herr&rsquo;s Ridge, upon which
Heth&rsquo;s Division was deployed at the opening of the battle on
July 1st. Opposite this ridge, and extending in the same direction,
is McPherson Ridge, where the Union cavalry forces under Buford
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
were deployed. Along Willoughby Run, which flows between these
ridges, the battle opened on July 1, 1863. The next elevation, immediately
north and west of the town, is known as Oak Ridge at
its northern extremity and as far south as the Chambersburg Pike;
from this point to its southern extremity it is called Seminary
Ridge, taking its name from the yet existing Lutheran Theological
Seminary. It was held by the Union Army on the first day of the
battle and formed its principal line of defence. On the second and
third days it was the principal Confederate line.</p>
<p>Seminary Ridge at its southern extremity drops off to a small
ravine beyond which is Warfield Ridge, which extends in a southerly
direction opposite Big Round Top; this formed the right of the
Confederate line of battle on the second and third days.</p>
<p>South and southwest of the town is Cemetery Ridge, of which
Big Round Top and Little Round Top are spurs, named from the
Evergreen Cemetery and the site of the National Cemetery after
the battle.</p>

<p>Cemetery Ridge formed the main line of battle of the Union
Army during the battles of the 2nd and 3rd. A short distance east
of the cemetery it bends sharply to the right, forming two rocky
and wooded prominences, Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Spangler&rsquo;s Hill. Between
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
Seminary Ridge on the west and Cemetery Ridge on the east, a low
ridge along the line of the Emmitsburg Road is designated Emmitsburg
Road Ridge. This extends to the Peach Orchard. It was
crossed on the afternoon of the 3rd by the assaulting column of
Pickett&rsquo;s Charge, and is one of the interesting points of the battle.
Another ridge on the west front of Little Round Top contains
Devil&rsquo;s Den, a mass of enormous granite rocks, apparently tossed
in confusion by some giant hand. In this picturesque spot Longstreet
made his famous assault against the Union left on the
afternoon of July 2nd. The trend of these various ridges conforms
generally to that of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>There are no large streams on the battlefield. The largest is
Marsh Creek, only a small part of which is within the Park area.
On the east is Rock Creek, extending the whole length of the Park,
so named on account of the immense boulders within the channel
and along the borders. On the north and west of Gettysburg is
Willoughby Run, also extending the entire length of the Park
and flowing south to Marsh Creek. Another small stream is Plum
Run, near the center, beginning on the Codori farm and running
south through the gorge at the Round Tops; this was crossed and
recrossed by both armies during the second and third days. Lying
wholly within the Potomac basin, all the streams flow south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The highest point within the Park is Big Round Top on the
south, which rises to an elevation of 786 feet, and is visible for
miles in all directions. From Big Round Top, Little Round Top,
Culp&rsquo;s Hill, Cemetery Hill, and Oak Hill there are extensive
panoramic views. Aside from the historic association there is much
in the magnificent and beautiful scenery to interest the visitor.
In the woods and meadows, in the glens and vales of the battlefield
there are romantic and charming bits of landscape. The prospect
from the National Cemetery as the sun disappears behind the
South Mountain is one of great beauty and impressiveness.</p>
<p>A large portion of the Park is covered with timber, chiefly the
different varieties of oak, hickory, ash, poplar, elm, gum, cedar,
and pine. Many of the groves are forests primeval, and in the
fall the lofty pines of Big Round Top, contrasting with the crimson
of the gigantic oaks covering it from base to summit and the gray-lichened
surface of the massive boulders, form a striking and
beautiful picture. Much care is given to the protection of the
groves, in order to preserve the original condition of the field.
Tree-surgery has prolonged the lives of trees of special historic
interest. Visitors return year after year in spring to see the glorious
masses of dogwood and redbud.</p>

<p>East Cavalry Field, 3 miles east of Gettysburg, is the point
from which Stuart&rsquo;s Cavalry started to move round the right
wing of the Union Army in order to reach the rear of Meade&rsquo;s line
at the time of Pickett&rsquo;s Charge. South Cavalry Field, 3 miles
south of Gettysburg, was held by Farnsworth&rsquo;s Brigade of Kilpatrick&rsquo;s
Division, and Merritt&rsquo;s Brigade of Buford&rsquo;s Division. All
these positions have been marked with suitable tablets. The
Cavalry Fields, though not contiguous to the main field, are
important parts of the National Military Park.</p>
<p>Gettysburg has two railroads: the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, and
the Western Maryland, affording service from all points. Ten
roads radiate from the town like the spokes of a wheel, and these
provide ample approaches. The Lincoln Highway, entering via
the Chambersburg Pike and continuing on the York Pike, gives a
through route from west to east, and the Harrisburg Road leads
directly to the State Capital. The Emmitsburg Road runs southwest
to Emmitsburg, and thence to Frederick and Washington.
The Baltimore Pike is a through route to Baltimore and the South.
The Hanover Road runs to Hanover on the east. There are also
the Taneytown and Hagerstown roads, the latter the line of
General Lee&rsquo;s retreat.</p>
<p>A uniformed guide service with an established schedule of rates
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
was authorized by the Secretary of War in 1916. No person is allowed
to act as guide for pay without being examined and licensed
by the Superintendent of the Park. There are interesting collections
of Civil War relics at the Jennie Wade House, the Lee Museum,
and other places. A single year has brought 800,000 visitors to the
field. The average yearly number is 700,000.</p>
<h2 id="c11">THE SOLDIERS&rsquo; NATIONAL CEMETERY</h2>
<p>Of the eighty-three cemeteries in the United States dedicated exclusively to the
burial of soldiers, that at Gettysburg was the first.</p>
<p>A few days after the battle, Governor A. G. Curtin, of Pennsylvania, solicitous
for the welfare of the soldiers, came to Gettysburg and appointed David Wills, a
leading attorney, to act as his agent in the work of establishing a cemetery. Correspondence
with the governors of other States was begun. Grounds were selected
by Mr. Wills, and by the direction of Governor Curtin purchased for the State of
Pennsylvania, to provide a burial-place for soldiers who fell in the battle.</p>
<p>Lots in the cemetery were tendered without cost to each State having dead
upon the field. The expense of removing the bodies, laying out, ornamenting and
enclosing the grounds, erecting a lodge for the keeper, and erecting a suitable
monument to the memory of the dead, was to be borne by the several States,
assessed in proportion to their population.</p>
<p>The seventeen acres of land which were purchased lie on Cemetery Hill adjoining
the Citizens&rsquo; Cemetery, at the apex of what had been the triangular battle-line
of the Union Army, and an important tactical position on July 2nd and 3rd.
At the time of the battle this land was a cornfield, divided by stone fences which
were used to great advantage by the infantry of the Union Army. The most elevated
portions had been points of vantage for many batteries of artillery.</p>
<p>The land was surrounded on the west, east, and north by a substantial, well-built
wall of native granite, topped by a heavy dressed coping. A division fence of iron
was erected between the Soldiers&rsquo; National Cemetery and the Citizens&rsquo; Cemetery.</p>
<p>The plans and designs for the laying out of the cemetery were prepared by
William Saunders, an able landscape gardener of the Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C. A semi-circular plan for the arrangement of the graves was
adopted. The ground allotted to each State converges upon a central point. The
size of each plot was determined by the number of graves belonging to each State.
The bodies were placed side by side in parallel trenches with a space of twelve feet
to each parallel and with a grass path between the rows of graves. The outer section
is lettered A, and so on in alphabetical order. Two feet of space was allowed to
each body, and a person standing in the center of the semi-circle and facing the
circumference reads the names from left to right. The bodies are laid with the
heads towards the center. The headstones are uniform in size and contain the name,
regiment and company of each soldier so far as it was possible to obtain them.
Another lot was set apart for the soldiers of the Regular Army. The graves of the
unknown dead are located at each end of the semi-circle.</p>
<p>On the 27th of October, 1863, the work of exhumation was begun under the
supervision of Samuel Weaver, a citizen of Gettysburg. It was completed on
March 18th, 1864. The number of bodies exhumed and interred in the cemetery
was 3,512, including 158 taken up by the authorities of Boston. Of the total number,
979 were unknown. Later other bodies were discovered and added, and the total
interred was 3,734. Many other Union dead were sent to their family burial places.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
The Confederate bodies remained in the original trenches until 1870-73, when
3,320 were transferred to southern cemeteries.</p>
<p>The central point of the semi-circle from which Lincoln delivered his address is
now occupied by the National Monument, one of the finest on the field. It is 60
feet in height; the pedestal, 25 feet square at the base, is crowned by a colossal
statue representing the Genius of Liberty. Projecting from the angles are four
buttresses, each supporting an allegorical statue. War is personified by an American
soldier. History, a figure with stylus and pen, records the achievements and names
of the dead. Peace is typified by a statue of an American mechanic; Plenty by a
female figure with a sheaf of wheat. The main die of the pedestal is panelled.
Upon one of the panels is inscribed an extract from Lincoln&rsquo;s Address.</p>
<p>From the point where this monument stands, a magnificent view is presented
to the beholder. Sloping gradually toward the north and the west, the entire
cemetery is spread out as a beautiful panorama, showing on a carpet of green the
semi-circle of graves, the driveways lined with rows of splendid maples, spruces,
birches, magnolias, and many other trees, as well as many clumps of shrubbery
filling the intervals between. A view from this point as the sun sinks behind the
distant range of the South Mountain is one long to be remembered.</p>
<p>Standing at the upper end of the cemetery is a lesser monument in the form of
an exedra, the center of which contains a bust of Lincoln. Two panels, one to the
left, the other to the right, contain inscriptions; one giving David Wills&rsquo; letter of
invitation to President Lincoln to attend the dedicatory exercises on November
19th, 1863; the other, Lincoln&rsquo;s immortal address in its entirety.</p>
<p>Opposite this monument is the Rostrum from which the memorial addresses
are now delivered. The first memorial exercise was held on May 30th, 1868, establishing
a custom continued until this day. Among the speakers of recent years,
either in the cemetery or on adjoining sections of the Park, have been Presidents
Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Coolidge, and Hoover; Vice-President Curtis; Pennsylvania
Governors Sproul and Pinchot, and Honorable James J. Davis.</p>

<h2 id="c12">LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG</h2>
<p>No action of the battle itself has been more variously reported
than the visit of President Lincoln at the time of the dedication
of the National Cemetery on November 19, 1863. A wise collector
and judge among many conflicting accounts is Dr. William E.
Barton, noted Lincoln scholar, who in his &ldquo;Lincoln at Gettysburg&rdquo;
has assembled all available material.</p>
<p>Dr. Barton gives various interesting reasons why Lincoln
chose to come to Gettysburg, though his presence was not very
earnestly desired by the committee of arrangements. His ability
as anything but a political speaker had not been demonstrated,
and it was feared that he might spoil the occasion. Until two
weeks before the dedication, the only invitation sent him was one
of the printed circulars mailed to all national officials, congressmen,
and others.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/img029.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="457" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">National Monument.</span>&mdash;On the site of National Monument stood the platform
from which Abraham Lincoln delivered his immortal address</p>
</div>
<p>He was eager, Dr. Barton thinks, to see the field of Gettysburg.
He had rejoiced in the victory, and had deplored with equal
earnestness Meade&rsquo;s cautious policy in making no pursuit. He
wished to urge the people to renewed devotion to the cause which
at that moment did not look altogether promising. He wished
also, Dr. Barton believes, to counteract the impression made by a
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
cruel slander which had wide circulation. Again and again newspapers
inimical to him had published an account of his visit to the
Antietam battlefield a year earlier, asserting that he had asked
his friend Ward Hill Lamon to sing a ribald song as they drove
about among the unburied dead.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Lincoln Memorial.</span>&mdash;Memorial in honor of Lincoln&rsquo;s Address

</div>
<p>Lincoln turned a deaf ear to most slanders, but this touched
him to the quick. It was not unlikely that he longed to prove the
libel false by a visit to another battlefield. The story continued
to be told, however, throughout his life.</p>
<p>Following is Ward Hill Lamon&rsquo;s account of the visit to Gettysburg,
from his &ldquo;Recollections of Lincoln.&rdquo; It is the opinion of the
author of this book, an eye-witness, that the reception which
Lamon describes had other causes than failure to value Lincoln&rsquo;s
words. The address was intended to be merely a simple dedication
which would not naturally be followed by applause. The audience
had stood through the address of Edward Everett which occupied
two hours, and through a prayer and musical numbers in addition.
Many of the crowd were turning away&mdash;they turned back and
listened earnestly, but with no impulse to applaud.</p>
<p>At the time of the dedication, Mr. Lamon was chief marshal
of the parade and was with Lincoln on the platform when the
address was delivered. Lamon writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... A day or two before the dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg,
Mr. Lincoln told me that he would be expected to make a speech on the occasion;
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
that he was extremely busy, and had no time for preparation; and that he greatly
feared he would not be able to acquit himself with credit, much less to fill the
measure of public expectation. From his hat (the usual receptacle for his private
notes and memoranda) he drew a sheet of foolscap, one side of which was closely
written with what he informed me was a memorandum of his intended address.
This he read to me, first remarking that it was not at all satisfactory to him. It
proved to be in substance, if not the exact words, what was afterwards printed as
his famous Gettysburg speech.</p>
<p>After its delivery on the day of commemoration, he expressed deep regret that
he had not prepared it with greater care. He said to me on the stand, immediately
after concluding the speech: &ldquo;Lamon, that speech won&rsquo;t scour! It is a flat failure,
and the people are disappointed.&rdquo; (The word &ldquo;scour&rdquo; he often used in expressing
his conviction that a thing lacked merit, or would not stand the test of close criticism
or the wear of time.) He seemed deeply concerned about what the people
might think of his address; more deeply, in fact, than I had ever seen him on any
public occasion. His frank and regretful condemnation of his effort, and more
especially his manner of expressing that regret, struck me as somewhat remarkable;
and my own impression was deepened by the fact that the orator of the day,
Mr. Everett, and Secretary Seward both coincided with Mr. Lincoln in his unfavorable
view of its merits.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">The Rostrum.</span>&mdash;From the vine-draped Rostrum many famous speakers
have addressed the throngs that visit Gettysburg on Memorial Day</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The occasion was solemn, impressive, and grandly historic. The people, it is
true, stood apparently spellbound; and the vast throng was hushed and awed into
profound silence while Mr. Lincoln delivered his brief speech. But it seemed to
him that this silence and attention to his words arose more from the solemnity of
the ceremonies and the awful scenes which gave rise to them, than anything he
had said. He believed that the speech was a failure. He thought so at the time,
and he never referred to it afterwards, in conversation with me, without some
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
expression of unqualified regret that he had not made the speech better in
every way.</p>
<p>On the platform from which Mr. Lincoln delivered his address, and only a
moment after it was concluded, Mr. Seward turned to Mr. Everett and asked him
what he thought of the President&rsquo;s speech. Mr. Everett replied, &ldquo;It is not what I
expected from him. I am disappointed.&rdquo; Then in his turn Mr. Everett asked,
&ldquo;What do you think of it, Mr. Seward?&rdquo; The response was, &ldquo;He has made a failure,
and I am sorry for it. His speech is not equal to him.&rdquo; Mr. Seward then turned to
me and asked, &ldquo;Mr. Marshal, what do you think of it?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I am sorry
to say that it does not impress me as one of his great speeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the face of these facts it has been repeatedly published that this speech was
received by the audience with loud demonstrations of approval; that &ldquo;amid the
tears, sobs, and cheers it produced in the excited throng, the orator of the day,
Mr. Everett, turned to Lincoln, grasped his hand and exclaimed, &lsquo;I congratulate
you on your success!&rsquo; adding in a transport of heated enthusiasm, &lsquo;Ah, Mr.
President, how gladly would I give my hundred pages to be the author of your
twenty lines!&rsquo;&rdquo; Nothing of the kind occurred. It is a slander on Mr. Everett, an
injustice to Mr. Lincoln, and a falsification of history. Mr. Everett would not have
used the words attributed to him, in the face of his own condemnation of the
speech uttered a moment before, without subjecting himself to the charge of being
a toady and a hypocrite; and he was neither one or the other.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the silence during the delivery of the speech, and the lack
of hearty demonstrations of approval immediately after its close, were taken by
Mr. Lincoln as certain proof that it was not well received. In that opinion we all
shared. If any person then present saw, or thought he saw, the marvelous beauties
of that wonderful speech, as intelligent men in all lands now see and acknowledge
them, his superabundant caution closed his lips and stayed his pen. Mr. Lincoln
said to me after our return to Washington, &ldquo;I tell you, Hill, that speech fell on the
audience like a wet blanket. I am distressed about it. I ought to have prepared
it with more care.&rdquo; Such continued to be his opinion of that most wonderful of all
his platform addresses up to the time of his death.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
